Introduction\\n3D facial shapes, which are de\u0002ned by the 3D geometry\\nof the faces of human beings, contain important information\\nabout human's facial expressions. Such information is in-\\nvariant to pose and lighting conditions, which have imposed\\nserious hurdles on many 2D facial analysis tasks such as\\n2D facial expression recognition. In light of this, the explo-\\nration and exploitation of 3D facial geometric information\\nin tackling various facial analysis problems have emerged\\nin the research community. Thanks to the fast-developing\\nand increasingly mature 3D range scanning products and\\ncomputer vision based techniques for 3D face reconstruc-\\ntion from one or more 2D images, the 3D facial geometric\\ninformation has been relatively extensively utilized in the\\nstudy of face recognition [4, 5]. However, unlike in the\\ncase of face recognition, far fewer work has been done on\\nfacial expression recognition which takes advantage of the\\n3D facial geometric information. The most obvious reasonfor this embarrassing situation is that there has long been a\\nlack of a publicly available 3D facial expression database to\\nserve as a common platform for the researchers in the \u0002eld.\\nWithout such a database, neither can the researchers start\\nwith problem investigation nor can they end in comparing\\ntheir results. Now the good news is, Yin et. al. at Bing-\\nhamton University have recently constructed a 3D facial\\nexpression database for facial behavior research and made\\nit publicly available [1]. This is de\u0002nitely the \u0002rst attempt\\nto make a publicly available 3D facial expression database\\nfor the research community. It is believed that the existence\\nof this database will have a great impact on the facial\\nbehavior relevant research in the next a few years to come.\\nWang et. al. [2] performed the very \u0002rst work of 3D\\nfacial expression recognition on the BU-3DFE database.\\nThey reported that the highest average recognition rate\\nthey had obtained on this database was 83.6% by using\\nelaborately extracted primitive facial surface features\\nand an LDA classi\u0002er. They also reported that the facial\\nexpressions of happiness and surprise were well identi\u0002ed\\nwith accuracies of 95% and 90.8%, respectively. They\\ncompared their results with the results obtained by two\\n2D appearance feature based methods, namely the well-\\nknown Gabor-wavelet (GW) approach and the Topographic\\nContext (TC) approach. In both cases, they showed that\\ntheir results outperformed those for the 2D methods. They\\ndemonstrated that by incorporating 3D facial geometric\\ninformation the facial expression recognition problem\\ncan be better solved. This is highly expectable because\\n3D facial shapes contain rich information about facial\\nexpressions and are more robust than 2D appearances.\\nSoyel and Demirel [3] also conducted 3D facial expres-\\nsion recognition work on the BU-3DFE database. They\\napplied a carefully tuned neural network architecture to \u0002ve\\ncharacteristic facial feature distances that represent the eye\\nopening, eyebrow height, mouth opening, mouth height,\\nand lip stretching. They reported that the average recogni-\\ntion rate of their system was 91.3% and the highest average\\nrecognition rate reached to 98.3% in the recognition of\\nsurprise. As of the writing of this paper, to the best of our\\nknowledge, this is the only work that claims better results\\n978-1-4244-2340-8/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE\\nFigure 1.

We propose\\na novel automatic feature selection method based on max-\\nimizing the average relative entropy of marginalized class-\\nconditional feature distributions and apply it to a complete\\npool of candidate features composed of normalized Eu-\\nclidean distances between 83 facial feature points in the 3D\\nspace. Using a regularized multi-class AdaBoost classi\u0002ca-\\ntion algorithm with three different weak classi\u0002ers, namely\\nNearest Neighbor (NN), Naive Bayes (NB), and LDA, we\\nachieve a 95.1% average recognition rate for six universal\\nfacial expressions, namely anger, disgust, fear, happiness,\\nsadness, and surprise. The highest average recognition rate\\nthat we obtain is 99.2% for the recognition of surprise. We\\ncompare these results with the results based on a set of man-\\nually devised features and demonstrate that the auto features\\nyield better results than the manual features. In addition, we\\nshow that our results outperform the results presented in the\\nprevious work [2] and [3], namely average recognition rates\\nof 83.6% and 91.3% on the same database, respectively.\\n2. Database description\\nThe BU-3DFE database was recently developed by Yin\\net. al. at Binghamton University. It was designed to sample\\n3D facial behaviors with different prototypical emotional\\nstates at various levels of intensities. There are a total of\\n100 subjects in the database. Among these subjects, 56\\nare female and 44 are male. The subjects are well dis-tributed across different ethnic or racial ancestries, includ-\\ning White, Black, East-Asian, Middle-East Asian, Hispanic\\nLatino, and others. While being recorded, each subject was\\nasked to perform the neutral facial expression as well as\\nsix universal facial expressions, namely anger (AN), dis-\\ngust (DI), fear (FE), happiness (HA), sadness (SA), and sur-\\nprise (SU). Each facial expression has four levels of inten-\\nsities (low, middle, high, highest or 01-04), except that the\\nneutral facial expression has only one intensity level (00).\\nThus, there are 25 3D facial expression models for each\\nsubject, resulting in 2500 3D facial expression models in\\nthe database.\\nAssociated with a 3D facial expression model are a raw\\n3D face mesh model, a cropped 3D face mesh model, a pair\\nof texture images with two-angle views (about +45oand -\\n45oaway from the face frontal normal), a frontal-view tex-\\nture image, a set of 83 facial feature points, and a facial pose\\nvector. These data give a complete 3D description of a face\\nunder a speci\u0002c facial expression. A detailed description\\nof the BU-3DFE database can be found in [1]. In this pa-\\nper, we only use the 83 facial feature points marked on the\\ncropped 3D face mesh model, as shown in Figure 2 (a). We\\nrefer to a cropped 3D face mesh model as a 3D facial ex-\\npression model. Some examples of the 3D facial expression\\nmodels in the BU-3DFE database are illustrated in Figure 1.\\n3. Feature extraction\\nIn this paper, we manually devise a set of features (here-\\nafter referred to as the manual features, as compared to the\\nautomatically selected features, namely the auto features)\\nbased on the normalized Euclidean distances between the\\nfacial feature points on the 3D facial expression models.\\nAccording to Ekman [6, 7], the six universal facial expres-\\nsions are coded by combinations of action units, which are\\ncaused by the movements of particular facial feature points.\\nSimilarly, the MPEG-4 standard [8] speci\u0002es that the six\\nuniversal facial expressions correspond to six unique fa-\\ncial con\u0002gurations, which can be obtained by adjusting the\\nweights of certain facial animation parameters (FAPs). The\\nFAPs will change the relative position of the facial feature\\npoints, resulting in distinct collocation patterns of facial fea-\\nture points. In light of this, we believe that the distances be-\\ntween certain facial feature points offer a sparse, compact,\\nyet information-rich representation of the 3D facial shape.Such representation is invariant to translations and rotations\\nof the 3D facial geometry.\\nWe extract a set of 24 features composed of the nor-\\nmalized distances between a subset of the 83 facial feature\\npoints. These distances are believed to play an important\\nrole in determining the various facial expressions. The 24\\nfeatures are shown in Figure 2 (b) and their textual descrip-\\ntions are given in Table 1.\\nSince the faces of different people tend to have differ-\\nent sizes and proportions, in order to make the features\\nperson-independent, we normalize the distances by facial\\nanimation parameter units (FAPUs), as guided by theMPEG-4 standard. In MPEG-4, the FAPUs serve to scale\\nthe FAPs in order that a single set of FAPs can be used with\\narbitrary face models. The FAPUs are de\u0002ned as fractions\\nof distances between certain feature points on a face model\\nin its neutral state and allow us to interpret the FAPs on\\narbitrary face models in a consistent way. The \u0002ve FAPUs\\nare shown in Figure 3. The distances are then divided by\\nthe corresponding FAPUs, given as the unit in Table 1.\\n4. Automatic feature selection\\nIn a typical pattern classi\u0002cation system, the features\\nare generally devised by experts from the domain of the\\nproblem. While expert-derived features are often compact\\nand useful, to derive them requires domain knowledge and\\nmany trials and errors. An attractive scheme is that we have\\na large pool of candidate features, which are relatively easy\\nto collect, and we want a computer algorithm to be able to\\nautomatically select the best features from this candidate\\nfeature pool.\\nIn order to perform automatic feature selection, one has\\nto tell the computer algorithm in what sense a feature is\\nconsidered the best. Since our goal is to classify patterns,\\nthe discrimination power comes in naturally. In general, the\\nmore discrimination power a feature possesses, the more\\nit will contribute to the classi\u0002cation accuracy. Thus, intu-\\nitively and naturally, we want an automatic feature selection\\nalgorithm to select from the candidate pool those features\\n11\\n13\\n1214\\n23246\\n41 2\\n7 8\\n15169101920212218 173\\n5\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 2.

       "      <td>3D Facial Expression Recognition Based on Primitive Surface Feature\\nDistribution\\nJun Wang, Lijun Yin, Xiaozhou Wei and Yi Sun\\nDepartment of Computer Science\\nState University of New Y ork at Binghamton, NY , 13902, USA\\nAbstract\\nThe creation of facial range models by 3D imaging sys-\\ntems has led to extensive work on 3D face recognition [19].\\nHowever, little work has been done to study the usefulness\\nof such data for recognizing and understanding facial ex-pressions. Psychological research shows that the shape of ahuman face, a highly mobile facial surface, is critical to fa-cial expression perception. In this paper, we investigate theimportance and usefulness of 3D facial geometric shapes to\\nrepresent and recognize facial expressions using 3D facial\\nexpression range data. We propose a novel approach to ex-\\ntract primitive 3D facial expression features, and then apply\\nthe feature distribution to classify the prototypic facial ex-\\npressions. In order to validate our proposed approach, we\\nhave conducted experiments for person-independent facial\\nexpression recognition using our newly created 3D facial\\nexpression database. We also demonstrate the advantages\\nof our 3D geometric based approach over 2D texture based\\napproaches in terms of various head poses.\\n1. Introduction\\nThere is a long history of interest in the problem of rec-\\nognizing human emotion from facial expressions, as well\\nas extensive studies on face perception over the last threedecades [8, 17]. Analyzing the emotional expression of ahuman face requires a number of preprocessing steps whichattempt to detect and locate characteristic facial regions, ex-\\ntract facial expression features, and model facial gestures\\nusing anatomic information about the face. Although all\\nthese steps are equally important, current research mostlyconcentrates on the facial expression feature detection anddescription, which is also the focus of this paper.\\nFacial expression features are mainly represented by\\nthree categories: (1) static versus dynamic (or temporal);(2) global versus local (or analytic); and (3) 2D versus\\n3D. Most research over the past thirty years has been di-\\nrected towards static/dynamic, analytic, 2D feature extrac-tion [9], focusing primarily on two types of features: 2D\\ngeometric features and appearance features from 2D static\\nimages [16, 18] or video sequences [4, 3, 31]. Geomet-ric features are described by a set of facial feature pointsused to derive facial organs’ shapes or expressive regions.Appearance features refer to the features exhibited on the\\nskin (e.g., frowns or wrinkles) [22] or action units [8, 6].\\nOver the past decade, a number of techniques have been\\nsuccessfully developed for facial expression recognition, in-cluding optical ﬂow [28, 10] and Gabor wavelets [16], andFACS-feature based techniques [22, 1, 6, 31]. The excel-lent review of recent advances in this ﬁeld can be found in\\n[5, 12, 17, 32]. All recent advances have been based on\\n2D images or videos, and most were primarily concerned\\nwith extracting prototypic expressions from frontal or near-frontal views of a face.\\nRecently, additional work has been done to improve the\\nperformance of facial expression recognition under vari-\\nous imaging conditions (e.g., pose, lighting, etc). Some\\nresearchers have successfully explored partial 3D informa-\\ntion for facial expression recognition, such as multiple-view\\nbased [18] and 3D model-based techniques [2, 13, 27, 30].\\nThese methods are still based on 2D data. Because the facial\\nexpression actuated by the facial muscle movement resultsin the facial skin shape variation, it is ideal to model thefacial expressions explicitly in a 3D space.\\nDue to the limitations in describing facial surface defor-\\nmation when 3D features are evaluated in 2D space, 2D\\nimages with a group of feature units may not accuratelyreﬂect complex and authentic facial expressions. More im-portantly, head pose and posture, which are precious cues inconjunction with facial action, reﬂect a person’s real emo-tion. Since people rarely express emotions without head\\nmotion or posture spontaneity, the assumption of frontalimages of faces under good illumination is to be unreal-istic. Therefore, there is a high demand to represent and\\nrecognize facial expressions in 3D space. In this paper, we\\naddress the issue regarding 3D global features on the 3Df a -\\ncial surface in order to mitigate the problems posted by 2Dbased facial expression analysis.\\nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) \\n0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006  IEEE \\n\\nThe3D surface features, reﬂecting the facial skin\\n“wave”, represent the intrinsic facial surface structure as-\\nsociated with the speciﬁc facial expressions. Motivated bythis fact, we propose a novel geometric feature based facialexpression descriptor in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space.\\nBased on the principal curvature information estimated onthe3D triangle mesh model, we apply a surface labeling\\napproach to classify the 3D primitive surface features into\\ntwelve basic categories. In order to classify the speciﬁc ex-\\npression, we partition the face surface into a number of ex-pressive regions, and conduct the statistics of the surface\\nprimitive label distribution on each region separately. The\\nstatistic histograms of the surface labels of all these regionsare combined to construct the speciﬁc facial expression fea-ture.\\nFinally, we validate our approach by the recognition ex-\\nperiments on our newly constructed 3D facial expression\\ndatabase. We conduct the experiments in the following\\nseveral aspects: the performance investigation of our 3D\\napproach; the comparison study with 2D appearance fea-\\nture based methods (Gabor-Wavelet method and our Topo-graphic Context method), including the front view case and\\nthe angle-view case. The experiments are executed in a\\nperson-independent manner, which means that the subject\\nbeing tested has never appeared in the training set. We haveselected four classiﬁers for the classiﬁcation experiments.Since the paper focuses on 3D facial expression descrip-\\ntion, the classiﬁcation algorithm design is not expatiated onin this paper.\\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In\\nSection 2, we introduce the surface primitive feature anal-ysis based on the computational geometry method. In Sec-tion 3, we describe the facial expression feature extractionfrom the primitive surface features distribution. Section 4reports the experimental results of the 3D facial expression\\nrecognition, followed by a comparison with the 2D appear-\\nance feature based approaches in Section 5. Finally, con-cluding remarks and discussion are given in Section 6.\\n2.3D Primitive Feature Analysis\\nThe surface feature analysis is based on the triangle\\nmeshes of faces, which are created by a 3D imaging system\\n[15]. The system captures a three dimensional point cloudand generates a meshed surface that models the face as 3D\\ntriangle mesh geometry. The 3D surface data points are less\\nthan300 microns apart, providing the capability of distin-\\nguishing between small differences regardless of lighting\\nor orientation during the original scan. Figure 1 shows an\\nexample of 3D facial expression range models with six pro-\\ntotypic facial expressions. In the following sub-sections, we\\nwill give a detailed description of the primitive facial feature\\nestimation and labeling of the range models.\\nFigure 1. An example of 3D facial range mod-\\nels showing six prototypic expressions, from\\nleft to right: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sad-\\nness, and Surprise . The textured models are\\nshown in the upper row, and the correspond-ing shaded models are in the lower row.\\n2.1. Principal Curvature Analysis by Local\\nSurface Fitting\\nThe shape information of a surface is “encoded” in its\\nprimitive geometric features (such as ridge, ravine, peak,pit, saddle, concave hill, convex hill, etc.), which may be\\nviewed as a digital signature of a facial expression. Thesefeatures are determined by the surface curvatures and theirprincipal directions. Curvature estimation techniques fortriangle meshes could be based on the mesh itself or al-\\nternatively on a local smooth approximation. In general,there are broadly two categories: discrete and continuous[11]. The ﬁrst refers to approximating curvatures by formu-\\nlating a closed form for differential geometry operators thatwork directly on the discrete representation of the underly-ing surface. The latter involves ﬁtting a surface locally, then\\ncomputing the curvatures by interrogating the ﬁtted surface.\\nOur experiment shows that curvature estimates derived by\\nlocally approximating the surface with a smooth polynomialfunction give better results than the discrete versions.\\nIn order to derive the geometry features of facial sur-\\nface, we give an analytic form of the regression functionfor smoothly ﬁtting the triangle mesh surface. Note thatalthough the triangle meshes are deﬁned in a global coordi-nate system, for easy computation, the ﬁtting procedure isperformed in a local coordinate system, which is centered\\nat the vertex to be examined.

This symbolization process can be realized bymapping the primitive surface features from a 3D geometric\\nspace to a discrete label space, which is formulated as:\\nQ:{/bardbl∇z/bardbl,v\\n1,v2,λ1,λ2}=⇒{Lm},m=1,2,..., M\\n(8)\\nwhere Qis a pre-deﬁned classiﬁcation rule and {Lm}is\\na set of surface categories with a total of Mtypes to be\\nidentiﬁed.\\nThere are several existing rules for primitive surface fea-\\nture classiﬁcation. For example, (1) the shape index basedclassiﬁcation [7]; (2) Tanaka’s method [21], which catego-\\nrized eight distinct features to describe local shapes accord-\\ning to the sign of two principal curvatures; (3) the topo-graphic classiﬁcation method [23, 26], which has been used\\nfor analyzing the 3D topographic surfaces of gray level im-\\nages. Depending on the classiﬁcation ﬁneness, the maximaltwelve distinct primitive features can be deﬁned. They are\\npeak, pit, ﬂat, ravine, ridge, saddle (including ridge saddle\\nand ravine saddle) and hill (including convex hill, concavehill, concave saddle hill, convex saddle hill and slope hill).\\nIn order to scrutinize the facial expression surface de-\\ntails, we use the twelve distinct primitive surface features torepresent the facial expressions. Similar to the classiﬁcation\\nrule used in [23], we extend the method to the application\\nfor the real 3D facial surface labeling. The labeling process\\nis based on the feature values of {/bardbl∇z/bardbl,v\\n1,v2,λ1,λ2}in\\nthe global coordinate system. To do so, two thresholds, TG\\nandTλ, are deﬁned. They are used to evaluate whether the\\ngradient magnitude and the principal curvatures are trivial\\nenough to be ignored as zero. The thresholds are calculated\\nbased on the mixed error criteria [26]:\\nTG= max[ /epsilon1,/epsilon1·z(x,y)]\\nTλ= max[ /epsilon1,/epsilon1·/bardblW/bardbl∞] (9)\\nwhere /bardblW/bardbl∞= max[ |A|+|B|,|B|+|C|](see Equation4) and /epsilon1is a user-speciﬁed parameter. In our method, we\\nuse/epsilon1=0.001·s, where sis the average distance from each\\nvertex to the center of the individual 3D facial model.\\nThe classiﬁcation rule for twelve primitive surface labels\\nis expounded in Table 1. In general, if /bardbl∇z/bardbl&lt;TGor there\\nis a zero crossing in the direction of the maximum curva-ture, one of the non-hillside labels is assigned; otherwise,\\none of the hill-side labels is assigned using the rule deﬁnedin the table.

Classiﬁcation rule of primitive 3D\\nsurface labels.\\n3. 3D Expression Description Based on Primi-\\ntive Label Distribution\\nAfter the labeling process, the facial expressions can be\\ndescribed by the distribution of the labels over the local orentire facial region. Intuitively, every facial expression is a\\nresult of facial muscle actuation, reﬂecting the facial surface\\nvariation. Such a variation results in the different distribu-tions of primitive surface labels. This fact suggests that the\\nprimitive label distribution could directly link to a distinct\\nfacial expression. In other words, the same type of facial\\nexpression is expected to share the similar primitive label\\ndistribution with a certain robustness, given a sufﬁcient res-olution of the range model.\\nTo ﬁnd an explicit representation of the fundamental\\nstructure of facial surface details, we investigate the statisti-cal distributions of the primitive surface labels in seven ex-\\npressive facial regions, which are deﬁned according to the\\nneuro-anatomy knowledge of conﬁguration of facial mus-\\ncles and their dynamics [20]. As shown in Figure 4, sixty-\\nfour ﬁducial points are deﬁned on the facial surface, and ac-cordingly, the seven expressive local regions are constructed\\nbased on these key points. Note that the interiors of mouth\\nand eyes are currently not included in the seven local re-\\ngions. The reasons are twofold: (1) the interiors of mouth\\nand eyes are isolated from the facial skin. They can be\\nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) \\n0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006  IEEE \\n\\n(b) (a)\\nFigure 4. 64facial ﬁducial points and 7se-\\nlected facial regions.\\ntreated as three separated objects. These “holes” are com-\\nplementary areas of the facial skin area. The change of their\\nshapes is directly reﬂected on the change of the surroundingskins which have been included in the seven expressive re-gions; (2) although tongues and eye-balls can be viewed asthe signatures of facial expressions, their appearances may\\nnot be as stable as the facial skin due to the dark hole effect\\nexisting in the current 3D imaging systems.\\nIn short, the selected seven local regions cover the most\\nexpressive areas on a human face. In each selected region,\\nwe identify the expression signature by calculating the his-togram distribution of primitive labels. Such a distributionis described as follows:\\nr\\ni=/bracketleftbiggni1\\nni,···,nim\\nni,···,niM\\nni/bracketrightbigg\\n(10)\\nwhere nimis the number of vertices which are labeled\\nby the label type Lm, andniis the total number of vertices\\nin the ith local region ( ni=M/summationtext\\nm=1nim).M=1 2 is the number\\nof the primitive label categories.\\nThe combination of seven histogram distributions of the\\nselected entire regions generates a unique expression de-\\nscriptor for a speciﬁc expression. As a result, the expres-\\nsion is described by the primitive surface feature distribu-tion (PSFD), which is expressed by\\nE=[r\\n1,···,ri,···,rK] (11)\\nwhere Kis the number of expressive regions ( K=7in our\\nexperiment).\\n4. Recognition Experiments\\n4.1. Database\\nWe constructed a 3D facial expression database for our\\nexperiment. The 3D range data is scanned by a 3DMD static\\ndigitizer [15], which uses a random light pattern projectionin the speckle projection ﬂash environment . The modelresolution is in the range of 20,000 polygons to 35,000\\npolygons, depending on the size of the face being scanned.The facial expressions with six universal emotional states,\\nAnger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness and Surprise , are\\nsampled in four different levels of intensity (e.g., from lesspronounced to more pronounced). In our experiment, we\\nused the data captured from 60subjects with two high-\\nintensity models for each expression. The test is based onthe six prototypic expressions.\\nEach range facial model consists of a meshed surface\\nmodel and an associated texture image. The head pose\\ncan be estimated by a triangle plane determined by the in-\\nner corners of two eyes and a nose tip. Given the head\\npose, the original scan is processed by rotating the model\\nto the frontal view. This pre-processing results in a work-\\ning model , on which we manually labeled 64ﬁdicual ver-\\ntices for the expression recognition experiments. Table 2\\ngives a summary of the data set that we used for our exper-\\niments.

Summary of the 3D facial expression\\ndata set used in our experiment.\\n4.2. Recognition Results\\nOur facial expression recognition experiments are car-\\nried out in a person-independent manner, which is believed\\nto be more challenging than a person-dependent approach\\n[17]. We randomly partitioned the 60subjects into two sub-\\nsets: one with 54subjects for training and the other with\\n6subjects for test. The experimental paradigm guarantees\\nthat any subject used for testing does not appear in the train-ing set because the random partition is based on the subjectsrather than the individual expression. Four popular clas-\\nsiﬁers: Quadratic Discriminant Classiﬁer (QDC), Linear\\nDiscriminant Analysis (LDA), Naive Bayesian Classiﬁer\\n(NBC), and Support V ector Classiﬁer (SVC) with RBF ker-\\nnel are used in the experiments. The tests are executed 20\\ntimes on each classiﬁer with different partitions to achieve\\na stable generalization recognition rate. The entire process\\nguarantees that every subject is tested at least once for each\\nclassiﬁer. For each round of the test, all the classiﬁers are\\nreset and re-trained from the initial state.\\nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) \\n0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006  IEEE \\n\\nClassiﬁer QDC LDA NBC SVC\\nRecognition rate 74.5% 83.6% 71.7% 77.8%\\nTable 3.

Comparison Study\\nIn this section, we compare the proposed 3D primitive\\nfeature distribution method (3D-PSFD) with two 2D ap-\\npearance feature based methods. One is the well-knownGabor-wavelet (GW) approach [16] and the other is our re-\\ncently developed Topographic Context (TC) approach [24].\\n(1) In the Gabor-wavelet (GW) based approach, a set of\\nmulti-scale and multi-orientation coefﬁcients are calculated\\nto describe the appearance variations in the facial region.\\nWe applied 6×3complex Gabor-wavelet ( 6orientations and\\n3spatial resolutions) on 34ﬁducial points. The coefﬁcients\\nof the real and imaginary parts can be computed as:\\nG+(x,y;ω,θ)=ω2\\nσ2·e−ω2(x2+y2)\\n2σ2·{cos[ω(xcosθ+ysinθ)]−e−σ2\\n2}\\nG−(x,y;ω,θ)=ω2\\nσ2·e−ω2(x2+y2)\\n2σ2·sin[ω(xcosθ+ysinθ)] (12)where we let σ=π. The three selected spatial scales\\nare{π/4,π/8,π/16}and the 6orientations selected are\\n{0,π/6,π/3,π/2,2π/3,5π/6}. The feature extracted at\\npixel(x,y)by a certain Gabor-wavelet kernel with parame-\\nters{ω,θ}is the amplitude of the real and imaginary coef-\\nﬁcients G=/radicalBig\\nG2\\n++G2−. Therefore in total, we extracted\\n18×34 = 612 wavelet features for each image.\\n(2) In our existing work, we developed a Topographic\\nContext (TC) based approach for facial expression recog-\\nnition based on 2D static images. The TC expression fea-\\ntures are the topographic primal sketch features inherent inthe2D facial images. We use such appearance features to\\ndescribe the distinct facial expressions. Similar to our 3D\\nbased approach, we used the feature statistics to representthe2D facial expressions. It has proved to be robust to fa-\\ncial landmark detection as a result of its intrinsic statisticsproperty (see details in [24]).\\nThe comparison study with the above two methods is\\nconducted under various head pose conditions, including\\ntwo cases: frontal view and non-frontal views.\\n5.1. Case 1: Frontal View\\nOur frontal-view images are generated from the texture-\\nmapped working models. All these images are normalized\\nto256×256 pixels. Several examples are shown in the\\ntop row of Figure 1. There are 60subjects with a total of\\n720 frontal-view facial images used for the test. The experi-\\nments are executed in a person-independent manner similar\\nto the strategy used in Section 4.2.\\nTable 5 reports the correct recognition rates using these\\ntwo methods. We found the Gabor-wavelet approach per-\\nforms poorly when using the SVC classiﬁer, which is not\\ncomparable to the results from the other three classiﬁers.\\nMethod \\Classiﬁer QDC LDA NBC\\nTopographic context method 73.8% 79.2% 70.9%\\nGabor-wavelets method 72.3% 74.1% 62.1%\\nTable 5.

Case 2: Non-frontal View\\nIn this section, we compare the performance of our 3D\\ngeometric based approach (PSFD) with the 2D appearance\\nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) \\n0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006  IEEE \\n\\nfeature based approaches under different head pose condi-\\ntions. We obtained the head pose information from the orig-\\ninal face scans by estimating the triangle face-plane formed\\nby the inner corners of two eyes and the tip of nose. Know-\\ning the 3D head pose, we are able to rotate the 3D model to a\\nfrontal view position or arbitrary pose positions without los-\\ning any geometric feature information. However, if viewedin the 2D projection plane, the appearance of 2D facial im-\\nages varies dramatically when the head pose is arbitrarilychanged. The difﬁculty to recover the missing appearanceinformation from 2D images makes 2D based facial expres-\\nsion recognition sensitive to head pose variations.\\nUsing our face range models, we have generated facial\\nexpression images under different views, corresponding todifferent head poses. This is done by rotating the models to\\na certain degree and generating the face images in that view\\nby texture-mapping. We generated the face images underviews of ±10\\n◦,±20◦,±30◦, and±40◦for each orienta-\\ntion (pitch and yaw rotation), resulting in 720 images for\\neach view. Figure 5 shows the examples of different facial\\nappearances under different views.\\nFigure 5. Facial expression images with dif-\\nferent head rotation. Top row is yaw rotation\\nand bottom row is pitch rotation. From left to\\nright, the rotation angle is −40◦,−30◦,−20◦,\\n20◦,30◦and40◦.\\nWe choose to use the LDA classiﬁer to evaluate the\\nexpression recognition performance under different head\\nposes because in most cases LDA outputs the best recog-\\nnition result. For all three algorithms (PSFD, GW, and TC),\\nthe LDA classiﬁer is trained using the front view face data.\\nThe recognition results with respect to different poses\\n(e.g., pitch and yaw rotations) are shown in Figure 6. From\\nthe ﬁgure, we can see that the average recognition rates\\nof the 2D appearance feature based methods degrade con-\\nsiderably as head rotation increases, especially the Gabor-wavelet method. The extraction of Gabor-wavelet coefﬁ-\\ncients is based on the selected ﬁducial points. The posechange alters the distribution of these ﬁducial points, and re-\\nsults in signiﬁcant distortion of Gabor-wavelet features. On\\nthe contrary, the 3D-PSFD based approach makes the 3D\\nprimitive feature distribution invariant to the pose variations\\nbecause the 3D geometric features are view-independent.\\nFigure 6. Comparison of the recognition per-\\nformance under different head orientations.\\nleft: pitch; right: yaw.\\n6. Concluding Remarks\\nIn this paper, we investigated the issue of 3D facial ex-\\npression representation and recognition. To the best of our\\nknowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to recognize facial ex-\\npressions using range data in a complete 3D space. We\\nhave proposed to extract and label the primitive 3D surface\\nfeatures, and derive their statistical distributions to repre-\\nsent the distinct prototypic facial expressions. We used the\\nprimitive surface feature distribution (PSFD) as the signa-\\nture to distinguish facial expressions, and conducted expres-sion recognition experiments using the person-independentstrategy. Compared to the existing 2D static image based\\napproaches (e.g., GW and TC methods), our 3D range data\\nbased approach shows superior performance as a result ofthe lighting and orientation invariance of 3D geometric fea-\\ntures. The experiments show encouraging results in recog-nizing six prototypic facial expressions under various head-\\npose conditions.\\nThere are some limitations in the current work:\\n(1)Our current data set contains only static expression\\nmodels. A database including dynamic 3D facial expres-\\nsion sequences is needed in order to study the subtle skin\\nmovement associated with facial expressions in 3D space.\\nWith the emergence of dynamic 3D imaging systems [25],\\nit is possible to investigate the feasibility of tracking action\\nunits in 3D space to further enhance the current FACS based\\nfacial expression recognition technique. Because the dis-\\ncriminability of 3D facial expressions is dependent on the\\nresolution of the 3D mesh, higher resolution models are re-\\nquired in order to improve the recognition performance.\\n(2) The current work involves the pre-processing of\\nrange data which requires manual selection of the surfaceﬁducial points. In order to realize an automatic system for3D facial expression analysis, algorithms for automatic de-tection of 3D surface features must be developed. The exist-\\ning approaches (e.g., free-form based [25], etc.) are promis-\\nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) \\n0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006  IEEE \\n\\ning for this purpose.\\nThe above issues give rise to our future research direc-\\ntions in order to improve facial expression analysis in the\\n3D space. In addition, we will investigate integrating 3D\\ngeometric shape and 2D texture information to improve our\\ncurrent approach.\\n7.

These subjects arewell distrib uted across dif-\\nferent ethnic orracial ancestries, including White, Black,\\nEast-Asian, Middle-East Asian, Hispanic Latino, andoth-\\ners. While being recorded, each subject wasaskedtoper-\\nform theneutral facial expression aswell assixuniversalfacial expressions, namely anger (AN), disgust (DI), fear\\n(FE), happiness (HA), sadness (SA), and surprise (SU).\\nEach facial expression hasfour different levelsofintensi-\\nties(low,middle, high, highest), except thattheneutral fa-\\ncialexpression hasonly oneintensity level.Thus, there are\\n253Dfacial expression models foreach subject, resulting\\nin2500 3Dfacial expression models inthedatabase.\\nAssociated with each 3Dfacial expression model area\\nraw3Dfacemesh model, acropped 3Dfacemesh model,\\napairoftexture images with two-angle views(about +45o\\nand-45oawayfrom thefacefrontal normal), afrontal-vie w\\ntexture image, asetof83facial feature points, andafa-\\ncialpose vector .These data giveacomplete 3Ddescription\\nofafaceunder aspeci\u0002c facial expression.

Similarly ,intheMPEG-4 standard [13],\\nthesixfacial expressions arede\u0002ned byfacial animation\\nparameters (FAPs), which specify precisely howmuch the\\nfacial feature points havetobemoved.Inlight ofthis, we\\nbelie vethatcertain properties ofthelinesegments connect-\\ningfacial feature points offerasparse, compact, anduseful\\nrepresentation ofthe3Dfacial geometry .\\nWetherefore extract asetof96features, which consist\\nofthenormalized distances andslopes ofthelinesegments\\nconnecting asubset ofthe83facial feature points.

Facial Expression Recognition Based on Automatically Selected Features\\nHao Tang and Thomas S. Huang\\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801\\nfhaotang2,huangg@ifp.uiuc.edu\\nAbstract\\nIn this paper, the problem of person-independent fa-\\ncial expression recognition from 3D facial shapes is inves-\\ntigated. We propose a novel automatic feature selection\\nmethod based on maximizing the average relative entropy\\nof marginalized class-conditional feature distributions and\\napply it to a complete pool of candidate features composed\\nof normalized Euclidean distances between 83 facial fea-\\nture points in the 3D space. Using a regularized multi-class\\nAdaBoost classi\u0002cation algorithm, we achieve a 95.1% av-\\nerage recognition rate for six universal facial expressions\\non the publicly available 3D facial expression database BU-\\n3DFE [1], with a highest average recognition rate of 99.2%\\nfor the recognition of surprise. We compare these results\\nwith the results based on a set of manually devised features\\nand demonstrate that the auto features yield better results\\nthan the manual features. Our results outperform the re-\\nsults presented in the previous work [2] and [3], namely\\naverage recognition rates of 83.6% and 91.3% on the same\\ndatabase, respectively.\\n1. Introduction\\n3D facial shapes, which are de\u0002ned by the 3D geometry\\nof the faces of human beings, contain important information\\nabout human's facial expressions. Such information is in-\\nvariant to pose and lighting conditions, which have imposed\\nserious hurdles on many 2D facial analysis tasks such as\\n2D facial expression recognition. In light of this, the explo-\\nration and exploitation of 3D facial geometric information\\nin tackling various facial analysis problems have emerged\\nin the research community. Thanks to the fast-developing\\nand increasingly mature 3D range scanning products and\\ncomputer vision based techniques for 3D face reconstruc-\\ntion from one or more 2D images, the 3D facial geometric\\ninformation has been relatively extensively utilized in the\\nstudy of face recognition [4, 5]. However, unlike in the\\ncase of face recognition, far fewer work has been done on\\nfacial expression recognition which takes advantage of the\\n3D facial geometric information. The most obvious reasonfor this embarrassing situation is that there has long been a\\nlack of a publicly available 3D facial expression database to\\nserve as a common platform for the researchers in the \u0002eld.\\nWithout such a database, neither can the researchers start\\nwith problem investigation nor can they end in comparing\\ntheir results. Now the good news is, Yin et. al. at Bing-\\nhamton University have recently constructed a 3D facial\\nexpression database for facial behavior research and made\\nit publicly available [1]. This is de\u0002nitely the \u0002rst attempt\\nto make a publicly available 3D facial expression database\\nfor the research community. It is believed that the existence\\nof this database will have a great impact on the facial\\nbehavior relevant research in the next a few years to come.\\nWang et. al. [2] performed the very \u0002rst work of 3D\\nfacial expression recognition on the BU-3DFE database.\\nThey reported that the highest average recognition rate\\nthey had obtained on this database was 83.6% by using\\nelaborately extracted primitive facial surface features\\nand an LDA classi\u0002er. They also reported that the facial\\nexpressions of happiness and surprise were well identi\u0002ed\\nwith accuracies of 95% and 90.8%, respectively. They\\ncompared their results with the results obtained by two\\n2D appearance feature based methods, namely the well-\\nknown Gabor-wavelet (GW) approach and the Topographic\\nContext (TC) approach. In both cases, they showed that\\ntheir results outperformed those for the 2D methods. They\\ndemonstrated that by incorporating 3D facial geometric\\ninformation the facial expression recognition problem\\ncan be better solved. This is highly expectable because\\n3D facial shapes contain rich information about facial\\nexpressions and are more robust than 2D appearances.\\nSoyel and Demirel [3] also conducted 3D facial expres-\\nsion recognition work on the BU-3DFE database. They\\napplied a carefully tuned neural network architecture to \u0002ve\\ncharacteristic facial feature distances that represent the eye\\nopening, eyebrow height, mouth opening, mouth height,\\nand lip stretching. They reported that the average recogni-\\ntion rate of their system was 91.3% and the highest average\\nrecognition rate reached to 98.3% in the recognition of\\nsurprise. As of the writing of this paper, to the best of our\\nknowledge, this is the only work that claims better results\\n978-1-4244-2340-8/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE\\nFigure 1.

The highest average recognition rate\\nthat we obtain is 99.2% for the recognition of surprise. We\\ncompare these results with the results based on a set of man-\\nually devised features and demonstrate that the auto features\\nyield better results than the manual features. In addition, we\\nshow that our results outperform the results presented in the\\nprevious work [2] and [3], namely average recognition rates\\nof 83.6% and 91.3% on the same database, respectively.\\n2. Database description\\nThe BU-3DFE database was recently developed by Yin\\net. al. at Binghamton University. It was designed to sample\\n3D facial behaviors with different prototypical emotional\\nstates at various levels of intensities. There are a total of\\n100 subjects in the database. Among these subjects, 56\\nare female and 44 are male. The subjects are well dis-tributed across different ethnic or racial ancestries, includ-\\ning White, Black, East-Asian, Middle-East Asian, Hispanic\\nLatino, and others. While being recorded, each subject was\\nasked to perform the neutral facial expression as well as\\nsix universal facial expressions, namely anger (AN), dis-\\ngust (DI), fear (FE), happiness (HA), sadness (SA), and sur-\\nprise (SU). Each facial expression has four levels of inten-\\nsities (low, middle, high, highest or 01-04), except that the\\nneutral facial expression has only one intensity level (00).\\nThus, there are 25 3D facial expression models for each\\nsubject, resulting in 2500 3D facial expression models in\\nthe database.\\nAssociated with a 3D facial expression model are a raw\\n3D face mesh model, a cropped 3D face mesh model, a pair\\nof texture images with two-angle views (about +45oand -\\n45oaway from the face frontal normal), a frontal-view tex-\\nture image, a set of 83 facial feature points, and a facial pose\\nvector. These data give a complete 3D description of a face\\nunder a speci\u0002c facial expression. A detailed description\\nof the BU-3DFE database can be found in [1]. In this pa-\\nper, we only use the 83 facial feature points marked on the\\ncropped 3D face mesh model, as shown in Figure 2 (a). We\\nrefer to a cropped 3D face mesh model as a 3D facial ex-\\npression model. Some examples of the 3D facial expression\\nmodels in the BU-3DFE database are illustrated in Figure 1.\\n3. Feature extraction\\nIn this paper, we manually devise a set of features (here-\\nafter referred to as the manual features, as compared to the\\nautomatically selected features, namely the auto features)\\nbased on the normalized Euclidean distances between the\\nfacial feature points on the 3D facial expression models.\\nAccording to Ekman [6, 7], the six universal facial expres-\\nsions are coded by combinations of action units, which are\\ncaused by the movements of particular facial feature points.\\nSimilarly, the MPEG-4 standard [8] speci\u0002es that the six\\nuniversal facial expressions correspond to six unique fa-\\ncial con\u0002gurations, which can be obtained by adjusting the\\nweights of certain facial animation parameters (FAPs). The\\nFAPs will change the relative position of the facial feature\\npoints, resulting in distinct collocation patterns of facial fea-\\nture points. In light of this, we believe that the distances be-\\ntween certain facial feature points offer a sparse, compact,\\nyet information-rich representation of the 3D facial shape.Such representation is invariant to translations and rotations\\nof the 3D facial geometry.\\nWe extract a set of 24 features composed of the nor-\\nmalized distances between a subset of the 83 facial feature\\npoints. These distances are believed to play an important\\nrole in determining the various facial expressions. The 24\\nfeatures are shown in Figure 2 (b) and their textual descrip-\\ntions are given in Table 1.\\nSince the faces of different people tend to have differ-\\nent sizes and proportions, in order to make the features\\nperson-independent, we normalize the distances by facial\\nanimation parameter units (FAPUs), as guided by theMPEG-4 standard. In MPEG-4, the FAPUs serve to scale\\nthe FAPs in order that a single set of FAPs can be used with\\narbitrary face models. The FAPUs are de\u0002ned as fractions\\nof distances between certain feature points on a face model\\nin its neutral state and allow us to interpret the FAPs on\\narbitrary face models in a consistent way. The \u0002ve FAPUs\\nare shown in Figure 3. The distances are then divided by\\nthe corresponding FAPUs, given as the unit in Table 1.\\n4. Automatic feature selection\\nIn a typical pattern classi\u0002cation system, the features\\nare generally devised by experts from the domain of the\\nproblem. While expert-derived features are often compact\\nand useful, to derive them requires domain knowledge and\\nmany trials and errors. An attractive scheme is that we have\\na large pool of candidate features, which are relatively easy\\nto collect, and we want a computer algorithm to be able to\\nautomatically select the best features from this candidate\\nfeature pool.\\nIn order to perform automatic feature selection, one has\\nto tell the computer algorithm in what sense a feature is\\nconsidered the best. Since our goal is to classify patterns,\\nthe discrimination power comes in naturally. In general, the\\nmore discrimination power a feature possesses, the more\\nit will contribute to the classi\u0002cation accuracy. Thus, intu-\\nitively and naturally, we want an automatic feature selection\\nalgorithm to select from the candidate pool those features\\n11\\n13\\n1214\\n23246\\n41 2\\n7 8\\n15169101920212218 173\\n5\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 2.

       "2  3D Facial Expression Recognition Based on Primitive Surface Feature\\nDistribution\\nJun Wang, Lijun Yin, Xiaozhou Wei and Yi Sun\\nDepartment of Computer Science\\nState University of New Y ork at Binghamton, NY , 13902, USA\\nAbstract\\nThe creation of facial range models by 3D imaging sys-\\ntems has led to extensive work on 3D face recognition [19].\\nHowever, little work has been done to study the usefulness\\nof such data for recognizing and understanding facial ex-pressions. Psychological research shows that the shape of ahuman face, a highly mobile facial surface, is critical to fa-cial expression perception. In this paper, we investigate theimportance and usefulness of 3D facial geometric shapes to\\nrepresent and recognize facial expressions using 3D facial\\nexpression range data. We propose a novel approach to ex-\\ntract primitive 3D facial expression features, and then apply\\nthe feature distribution to classify the prototypic facial ex-\\npressions. In order to validate our proposed approach, we\\nhave conducted experiments for person-independent facial\\nexpression recognition using our newly created 3D facial\\nexpression database. We also demonstrate the advantages\\nof our 3D geometric based approach over 2D texture based\\napproaches in terms of various head poses.\\n1. Introduction\\nThere is a long history of interest in the problem of rec-\\nognizing human emotion from facial expressions, as well\\nas extensive studies on face perception over the last threedecades [8, 17]. Analyzing the emotional expression of ahuman face requires a number of preprocessing steps whichattempt to detect and locate characteristic facial regions, ex-\\ntract facial expression features, and model facial gestures\\nusing anatomic information about the face. Although all\\nthese steps are equally important, current research mostlyconcentrates on the facial expression feature detection anddescription, which is also the focus of this paper.\\nFacial expression features are mainly represented by\\nthree categories: (1) static versus dynamic (or temporal);(2) global versus local (or analytic); and (3) 2D versus\\n3D. Most research over the past thirty years has been di-\\nrected towards static/dynamic, analytic, 2D feature extrac-tion [9], focusing primarily on two types of features: 2D\\ngeometric features and appearance features from 2D static\\nimages [16, 18] or video sequences [4, 3, 31]. Geomet-ric features are described by a set of facial feature pointsused to derive facial organs’ shapes or expressive regions.Appearance features refer to the features exhibited on the\\nskin (e.g., frowns or wrinkles) [22] or action units [8, 6].\\nOver the past decade, a number of techniques have been\\nsuccessfully developed for facial expression recognition, in-cluding optical ﬂow [28, 10] and Gabor wavelets [16], andFACS-feature based techniques [22, 1, 6, 31]. The excel-lent review of recent advances in this ﬁeld can be found in\\n[5, 12, 17, 32]. All recent advances have been based on\\n2D images or videos, and most were primarily concerned\\nwith extracting prototypic expressions from frontal or near-frontal views of a face.\\nRecently, additional work has been done to improve the\\nperformance of facial expression recognition under vari-\\nous imaging conditions (e.g., pose, lighting, etc). Some\\nresearchers have successfully explored partial 3D informa-\\ntion for facial expression recognition, such as multiple-view\\nbased [18] and 3D model-based techniques [2, 13, 27, 30].\\nThese methods are still based on 2D data. Because the facial\\nexpression actuated by the facial muscle movement resultsin the facial skin shape variation, it is ideal to model thefacial expressions explicitly in a 3D space.\\nDue to the limitations in describing facial surface defor-\\nmation when 3D features are evaluated in 2D space, 2D\\nimages with a group of feature units may not accuratelyreﬂect complex and authentic facial expressions. More im-portantly, head pose and posture, which are precious cues inconjunction with facial action, reﬂect a person’s real emo-tion. Since people rarely express emotions without head\\nmotion or posture spontaneity, the assumption of frontalimages of faces under good illumination is to be unreal-istic. Therefore, there is a high demand to represent and\\nrecognize facial expressions in 3D space. In this paper, we\\naddress the issue regarding 3D global features on the 3Df a -\\ncial surface in order to mitigate the problems posted by 2Dbased facial expression analysis.\\nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) \\n0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006  IEEE \\n\\nThe3D surface features, reﬂecting the facial skin\\n“wave”, represent the intrinsic facial surface structure as-\\nsociated with the speciﬁc facial expressions. Motivated bythis fact, we propose a novel geometric feature based facialexpression descriptor in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space.\\nBased on the principal curvature information estimated onthe3D triangle mesh model, we apply a surface labeling\\napproach to classify the 3D primitive surface features into\\ntwelve basic categories. In order to classify the speciﬁc ex-\\npression, we partition the face surface into a number of ex-pressive regions, and conduct the statistics of the surface\\nprimitive label distribution on each region separately. The\\nstatistic histograms of the surface labels of all these regionsare combined to construct the speciﬁc facial expression fea-ture.\\nFinally, we validate our approach by the recognition ex-\\nperiments on our newly constructed 3D facial expression\\ndatabase. We conduct the experiments in the following\\nseveral aspects: the performance investigation of our 3D\\napproach; the comparison study with 2D appearance fea-\\nture based methods (Gabor-Wavelet method and our Topo-graphic Context method), including the front view case and\\nthe angle-view case. The experiments are executed in a\\nperson-independent manner, which means that the subject\\nbeing tested has never appeared in the training set. We haveselected four classiﬁers for the classiﬁcation experiments.Since the paper focuses on 3D facial expression descrip-\\ntion, the classiﬁcation algorithm design is not expatiated onin this paper.\\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In\\nSection 2, we introduce the surface primitive feature anal-ysis based on the computational geometry method. In Sec-tion 3, we describe the facial expression feature extractionfrom the primitive surface features distribution. Section 4reports the experimental results of the 3D facial expression\\nrecognition, followed by a comparison with the 2D appear-\\nance feature based approaches in Section 5. Finally, con-cluding remarks and discussion are given in Section 6.\\n2.3D Primitive Feature Analysis\\nThe surface feature analysis is based on the triangle\\nmeshes of faces, which are created by a 3D imaging system\\n[15]. The system captures a three dimensional point cloudand generates a meshed surface that models the face as 3D\\ntriangle mesh geometry. The 3D surface data points are less\\nthan300 microns apart, providing the capability of distin-\\nguishing between small differences regardless of lighting\\nor orientation during the original scan. Figure 1 shows an\\nexample of 3D facial expression range models with six pro-\\ntotypic facial expressions. In the following sub-sections, we\\nwill give a detailed description of the primitive facial feature\\nestimation and labeling of the range models.\\nFigure 1. An example of 3D facial range mod-\\nels showing six prototypic expressions, from\\nleft to right: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sad-\\nness, and Surprise . The textured models are\\nshown in the upper row, and the correspond-ing shaded models are in the lower row.\\n2.1. Principal Curvature Analysis by Local\\nSurface Fitting\\nThe shape information of a surface is “encoded” in its\\nprimitive geometric features (such as ridge, ravine, peak,pit, saddle, concave hill, convex hill, etc.), which may be\\nviewed as a digital signature of a facial expression. Thesefeatures are determined by the surface curvatures and theirprincipal directions. Curvature estimation techniques fortriangle meshes could be based on the mesh itself or al-\\nternatively on a local smooth approximation. In general,there are broadly two categories: discrete and continuous[11]. The ﬁrst refers to approximating curvatures by formu-\\nlating a closed form for differential geometry operators thatwork directly on the discrete representation of the underly-ing surface. The latter involves ﬁtting a surface locally, then\\ncomputing the curvatures by interrogating the ﬁtted surface.\\nOur experiment shows that curvature estimates derived by\\nlocally approximating the surface with a smooth polynomialfunction give better results than the discrete versions.\\nIn order to derive the geometry features of facial sur-\\nface, we give an analytic form of the regression functionfor smoothly ﬁtting the triangle mesh surface. Note thatalthough the triangle meshes are deﬁned in a global coordi-nate system, for easy computation, the ﬁtting procedure isperformed in a local coordinate system, which is centered\\nat the vertex to be examined. The local coordinate systemfor the surface ﬁtting is deﬁned as follows: let pbe a vertex\\non a 3D model M, andn\\np=(a,b, c)Tbe the unit nor-\\nmal at vertex p. A set of vertices that are adjacent to pis\\n{qi=(xi,yi,zi)T},i=1,2...,m . A local coordinate sys-\\ntem is deﬁned by taking the vertex pas an origin and ( nx,\\nny,np) as the three axes. nxandnyare two orthogonal\\naxes, which are arbitrarily selected to form a tangent planeperpendicular to the normal vector n\\npat crossing point p\\n(see Figure 2 for an example). The normal vector can be\\nsimply estimated by the mean normal, which is obtained by\\nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) \\n0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006  IEEE \\n\\nnp\\nv1\\nv2nx\\nny\\nxy\\nzp\\nFigure 2.

Theresulting vertices ˜q\\niand the corresponding normal vectors\\n˜n˜qiare expressed as:\\n˜qi=RT·(qi−p)\\n˜n˜qi=RT·nqi (1)\\nwhere the rotation matrix is obtained by R=[nxnynp].\\nThe vertex pand its normal npare transformed to the origin\\n˜p=( 0,0,0)Tand the unit vector ˜np=( 0,0,1)Talong the\\npositive zaxis, respectively.\\nThe approximating polynomial surface is at least sec-\\nond order. Considering the ﬁtting accuracy and the compu-tation complexity, we choose a cubic-order approximationmethod. Similar to the method in [14], we deﬁne the ﬁttingfunction in the form of\\nz(˜x,˜y)=U·X (2)\\nwhere the variable Uand the coefﬁcient Xare deﬁned as:\\nU=(1\\n2˜x2˜x˜y1\\n2˜y2˜x3˜x2˜y˜x˜y2˜y3)\\nX=(ABCDEFG )T(3)\\nGiven a set of neighbor vertices {˜qi=( ˜xi,˜yi,˜zi)T},\\n(i=1,2,..., m )and their corresponding normals {˜n˜qi=(ai,bi,ci)T}, we can establish 3mequations to solve the\\nseven parameters of X. When the vertex phas more than\\nthree neighbor vertices, the parameters Xcan be approx-\\nimated using the least-square ﬁtting method. With the re-\\ngressed local ﬁtting function z(˜x,˜y), the Weingarten matrix\\nfor the surface patch becomes:\\nW=/bracketleftBigg∂2z(˜x,˜y)\\n∂˜x2∂2z(˜x,˜y)\\n∂˜x∂˜y\\n∂2z(˜x,˜y)\\n∂˜x∂˜y∂2z(˜x,˜y)\\n∂˜y2/bracketrightBigg\\n=/bracketleftbiggAB\\nBC/bracketrightbigg\\n(4)\\nAfter the eigenvalue decomposition, the principal direc-\\ntions in the local coordinates ˜ v1and˜ v2can be estimated.\\nW=(˜ v1˜ v2)·diag(λ1λ2)·(˜ v1˜ v2)T(5)\\nwhere λ1andλ2are the eigenvalues and ˜ v1and˜ v2are the\\northogonal eigenvectors. If |λ1|>|λ2|,˜v1and˜v2are in the\\ndirections with the maximum curvature and the minimum\\ncurvature, respectively. Figure 3(a)(b) shows an example ofthe principal direction estimation on a facial range model.\\nSince the principal directions are represented in the local\\ncoordinate system, to obtain a global view of the principal\\ndirections, ˜ v\\n1and˜ v2must be rotated back to the global\\ncoordinate system, as formulated by\\nv1=R·˜ v1,v2=R·˜ v2 (6)\\nIt is worth noting that our surface labeling criteria rely\\non the surface principal curvatures, the principal directions\\nas well as the surface gradient. After the transformation\\nfrom the local coordinate system to the original global co-ordinate system, we can derive the gradient using the nor-mal direction of each surface point. Let z(x,y)be the ﬁt-\\nting function of a surface patch centered at p, the normal\\ndirection n\\np=(a,b, c)Tcan be written in the form of\\n(−∂z(x,y)\\n∂x,−∂z(x,y)\\n∂y,−1)T. The gradient magnitude /bardbl∇z(x,y)/bardbl\\natpis then calculated as:\\n/bardbl∇z(x,y)/bardbl=/radicalBig\\n[∂z(x,y)\\n∂x]2+[∂z(x,y)\\n∂x]2=/radicalBig\\n[−a\\nc]2+[−b\\nc]2(7)\\nThe principal curvature analysis produced a set of at-\\ntributes {/bardbl∇z/bardbl,v1,v2,λ1,λ2}, which describes the sur-\\nface property at each vertex.

In other words, we can symbolize\\nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) \\n0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006  IEEE \\n\\n(a)\\n (b) (c)\\nFigure 3.

This symbolization process can be realized bymapping the primitive surface features from a 3D geometric\\nspace to a discrete label space, which is formulated as:\\nQ:{/bardbl∇z/bardbl,v\\n1,v2,λ1,λ2}=⇒{Lm},m=1,2,..., M\\n(8)\\nwhere Qis a pre-deﬁned classiﬁcation rule and {Lm}is\\na set of surface categories with a total of Mtypes to be\\nidentiﬁed.\\nThere are several existing rules for primitive surface fea-\\nture classiﬁcation. For example, (1) the shape index basedclassiﬁcation [7]; (2) Tanaka’s method [21], which catego-\\nrized eight distinct features to describe local shapes accord-\\ning to the sign of two principal curvatures; (3) the topo-graphic classiﬁcation method [23, 26], which has been used\\nfor analyzing the 3D topographic surfaces of gray level im-\\nages. Depending on the classiﬁcation ﬁneness, the maximaltwelve distinct primitive features can be deﬁned. They are\\npeak, pit, ﬂat, ravine, ridge, saddle (including ridge saddle\\nand ravine saddle) and hill (including convex hill, concavehill, concave saddle hill, convex saddle hill and slope hill).\\nIn order to scrutinize the facial expression surface de-\\ntails, we use the twelve distinct primitive surface features torepresent the facial expressions. Similar to the classiﬁcation\\nrule used in [23], we extend the method to the application\\nfor the real 3D facial surface labeling. The labeling process\\nis based on the feature values of {/bardbl∇z/bardbl,v\\n1,v2,λ1,λ2}in\\nthe global coordinate system. To do so, two thresholds, TG\\nandTλ, are deﬁned. They are used to evaluate whether the\\ngradient magnitude and the principal curvatures are trivial\\nenough to be ignored as zero. The thresholds are calculated\\nbased on the mixed error criteria [26]:\\nTG= max[ /epsilon1,/epsilon1·z(x,y)]\\nTλ= max[ /epsilon1,/epsilon1·/bardblW/bardbl∞] (9)\\nwhere /bardblW/bardbl∞= max[ |A|+|B|,|B|+|C|](see Equation4) and /epsilon1is a user-speciﬁed parameter. In our method, we\\nuse/epsilon1=0.001·s, where sis the average distance from each\\nvertex to the center of the individual 3D facial model.\\nThe classiﬁcation rule for twelve primitive surface labels\\nis expounded in Table 1. In general, if /bardbl∇z/bardbl<TGor there\\nis a zero crossing in the direction of the maximum curva-ture, one of the non-hillside labels is assigned; otherwise,\\none of the hill-side labels is assigned using the rule deﬁnedin the table.

Intuitively, every facial expression is a\\nresult of facial muscle actuation, reﬂecting the facial surface\\nvariation. Such a variation results in the different distribu-tions of primitive surface labels. This fact suggests that the\\nprimitive label distribution could directly link to a distinct\\nfacial expression. In other words, the same type of facial\\nexpression is expected to share the similar primitive label\\ndistribution with a certain robustness, given a sufﬁcient res-olution of the range model.\\nTo ﬁnd an explicit representation of the fundamental\\nstructure of facial surface details, we investigate the statisti-cal distributions of the primitive surface labels in seven ex-\\npressive facial regions, which are deﬁned according to the\\nneuro-anatomy knowledge of conﬁguration of facial mus-\\ncles and their dynamics [20]. As shown in Figure 4, sixty-\\nfour ﬁducial points are deﬁned on the facial surface, and ac-cordingly, the seven expressive local regions are constructed\\nbased on these key points. Note that the interiors of mouth\\nand eyes are currently not included in the seven local re-\\ngions. The reasons are twofold: (1) the interiors of mouth\\nand eyes are isolated from the facial skin. They can be\\nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) \\n0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006  IEEE \\n\\n(b) (a)\\nFigure 4. 64facial ﬁducial points and 7se-\\nlected facial regions.\\ntreated as three separated objects. These “holes” are com-\\nplementary areas of the facial skin area. The change of their\\nshapes is directly reﬂected on the change of the surroundingskins which have been included in the seven expressive re-gions; (2) although tongues and eye-balls can be viewed asthe signatures of facial expressions, their appearances may\\nnot be as stable as the facial skin due to the dark hole effect\\nexisting in the current 3D imaging systems.\\nIn short, the selected seven local regions cover the most\\nexpressive areas on a human face. In each selected region,\\nwe identify the expression signature by calculating the his-togram distribution of primitive labels. Such a distributionis described as follows:\\nr\\ni=/bracketleftbiggni1\\nni,···,nim\\nni,···,niM\\nni/bracketrightbigg\\n(10)\\nwhere nimis the number of vertices which are labeled\\nby the label type Lm, andniis the total number of vertices\\nin the ith local region ( ni=M/summationtext\\nm=1nim).M=1 2 is the number\\nof the primitive label categories.\\nThe combination of seven histogram distributions of the\\nselected entire regions generates a unique expression de-\\nscriptor for a speciﬁc expression. As a result, the expres-\\nsion is described by the primitive surface feature distribu-tion (PSFD), which is expressed by\\nE=[r\\n1,···,ri,···,rK] (11)\\nwhere Kis the number of expressive regions ( K=7in our\\nexperiment).\\n4. Recognition Experiments\\n4.1. Database\\nWe constructed a 3D facial expression database for our\\nexperiment. The 3D range data is scanned by a 3DMD static\\ndigitizer [15], which uses a random light pattern projectionin the speckle projection ﬂash environment . The modelresolution is in the range of 20,000 polygons to 35,000\\npolygons, depending on the size of the face being scanned.The facial expressions with six universal emotional states,\\nAnger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness and Surprise , are\\nsampled in four different levels of intensity (e.g., from lesspronounced to more pronounced). In our experiment, we\\nused the data captured from 60subjects with two high-\\nintensity models for each expression. The test is based onthe six prototypic expressions.\\nEach range facial model consists of a meshed surface\\nmodel and an associated texture image. The head pose\\ncan be estimated by a triangle plane determined by the in-\\nner corners of two eyes and a nose tip. Given the head\\npose, the original scan is processed by rotating the model\\nto the frontal view. This pre-processing results in a work-\\ning model , on which we manually labeled 64ﬁdicual ver-\\ntices for the expression recognition experiments. Table 2\\ngives a summary of the data set that we used for our exper-\\niments. A detail description of the database construction,\\npost-processing, and organization can be found in [29].\\n# of subjects # of expres-\\nsion types# of samples for each\\nsubject of each ex-\\npressiontotal # of sam-\\nples\\n60 6 2 720\\nTable 2.

Recognition Results\\nOur facial expression recognition experiments are car-\\nried out in a person-independent manner, which is believed\\nto be more challenging than a person-dependent approach\\n[17]. We randomly partitioned the 60subjects into two sub-\\nsets: one with 54subjects for training and the other with\\n6subjects for test. The experimental paradigm guarantees\\nthat any subject used for testing does not appear in the train-ing set because the random partition is based on the subjectsrather than the individual expression. Four popular clas-\\nsiﬁers: Quadratic Discriminant Classiﬁer (QDC), Linear\\nDiscriminant Analysis (LDA), Naive Bayesian Classiﬁer\\n(NBC), and Support V ector Classiﬁer (SVC) with RBF ker-\\nnel are used in the experiments. The tests are executed 20\\ntimes on each classiﬁer with different partitions to achieve\\na stable generalization recognition rate. The entire process\\nguarantees that every subject is tested at least once for each\\nclassiﬁer. For each round of the test, all the classiﬁers are\\nreset and re-trained from the initial state.\\nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) \\n0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006  IEEE \\n\\nClassiﬁer QDC LDA NBC SVC\\nRecognition rate 74.5% 83.6% 71.7% 77.8%\\nTable 3.

Comparison Study\\nIn this section, we compare the proposed 3D primitive\\nfeature distribution method (3D-PSFD) with two 2D ap-\\npearance feature based methods. One is the well-knownGabor-wavelet (GW) approach [16] and the other is our re-\\ncently developed Topographic Context (TC) approach [24].\\n(1) In the Gabor-wavelet (GW) based approach, a set of\\nmulti-scale and multi-orientation coefﬁcients are calculated\\nto describe the appearance variations in the facial region.\\nWe applied 6×3complex Gabor-wavelet ( 6orientations and\\n3spatial resolutions) on 34ﬁducial points. The coefﬁcients\\nof the real and imaginary parts can be computed as:\\nG+(x,y;ω,θ)=ω2\\nσ2·e−ω2(x2+y2)\\n2σ2·{cos[ω(xcosθ+ysinθ)]−e−σ2\\n2}\\nG−(x,y;ω,θ)=ω2\\nσ2·e−ω2(x2+y2)\\n2σ2·sin[ω(xcosθ+ysinθ)] (12)where we let σ=π. The three selected spatial scales\\nare{π/4,π/8,π/16}and the 6orientations selected are\\n{0,π/6,π/3,π/2,2π/3,5π/6}. The feature extracted at\\npixel(x,y)by a certain Gabor-wavelet kernel with parame-\\nters{ω,θ}is the amplitude of the real and imaginary coef-\\nﬁcients G=/radicalBig\\nG2\\n++G2−. Therefore in total, we extracted\\n18×34 = 612 wavelet features for each image.\\n(2) In our existing work, we developed a Topographic\\nContext (TC) based approach for facial expression recog-\\nnition based on 2D static images. The TC expression fea-\\ntures are the topographic primal sketch features inherent inthe2D facial images. We use such appearance features to\\ndescribe the distinct facial expressions. Similar to our 3D\\nbased approach, we used the feature statistics to representthe2D facial expressions. It has proved to be robust to fa-\\ncial landmark detection as a result of its intrinsic statisticsproperty (see details in [24]).\\nThe comparison study with the above two methods is\\nconducted under various head pose conditions, including\\ntwo cases: frontal view and non-frontal views.\\n5.1. Case 1: Frontal View\\nOur frontal-view images are generated from the texture-\\nmapped working models. All these images are normalized\\nto256×256 pixels. Several examples are shown in the\\ntop row of Figure 1. There are 60subjects with a total of\\n720 frontal-view facial images used for the test. The experi-\\nments are executed in a person-independent manner similar\\nto the strategy used in Section 4.2.\\nTable 5 reports the correct recognition rates using these\\ntwo methods. We found the Gabor-wavelet approach per-\\nforms poorly when using the SVC classiﬁer, which is not\\ncomparable to the results from the other three classiﬁers.\\nMethod \\Classiﬁer QDC LDA NBC\\nTopographic context method 73.8% 79.2% 70.9%\\nGabor-wavelets method 72.3% 74.1% 62.1%\\nTable 5.

Case 2: Non-frontal View\\nIn this section, we compare the performance of our 3D\\ngeometric based approach (PSFD) with the 2D appearance\\nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) \\n0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006  IEEE \\n\\nfeature based approaches under different head pose condi-\\ntions. We obtained the head pose information from the orig-\\ninal face scans by estimating the triangle face-plane formed\\nby the inner corners of two eyes and the tip of nose. Know-\\ning the 3D head pose, we are able to rotate the 3D model to a\\nfrontal view position or arbitrary pose positions without los-\\ning any geometric feature information. However, if viewedin the 2D projection plane, the appearance of 2D facial im-\\nages varies dramatically when the head pose is arbitrarilychanged. The difﬁculty to recover the missing appearanceinformation from 2D images makes 2D based facial expres-\\nsion recognition sensitive to head pose variations.\\nUsing our face range models, we have generated facial\\nexpression images under different views, corresponding todifferent head poses. This is done by rotating the models to\\na certain degree and generating the face images in that view\\nby texture-mapping. We generated the face images underviews of ±10\\n◦,±20◦,±30◦, and±40◦for each orienta-\\ntion (pitch and yaw rotation), resulting in 720 images for\\neach view. Figure 5 shows the examples of different facial\\nappearances under different views.\\nFigure 5. Facial expression images with dif-\\nferent head rotation. Top row is yaw rotation\\nand bottom row is pitch rotation. From left to\\nright, the rotation angle is −40◦,−30◦,−20◦,\\n20◦,30◦and40◦.\\nWe choose to use the LDA classiﬁer to evaluate the\\nexpression recognition performance under different head\\nposes because in most cases LDA outputs the best recog-\\nnition result. For all three algorithms (PSFD, GW, and TC),\\nthe LDA classiﬁer is trained using the front view face data.\\nThe recognition results with respect to different poses\\n(e.g., pitch and yaw rotations) are shown in Figure 6. From\\nthe ﬁgure, we can see that the average recognition rates\\nof the 2D appearance feature based methods degrade con-\\nsiderably as head rotation increases, especially the Gabor-wavelet method. The extraction of Gabor-wavelet coefﬁ-\\ncients is based on the selected ﬁducial points. The posechange alters the distribution of these ﬁducial points, and re-\\nsults in signiﬁcant distortion of Gabor-wavelet features. On\\nthe contrary, the 3D-PSFD based approach makes the 3D\\nprimitive feature distribution invariant to the pose variations\\nbecause the 3D geometric features are view-independent.\\nFigure 6. Comparison of the recognition per-\\nformance under different head orientations.\\nleft: pitch; right: yaw.\\n6. Concluding Remarks\\nIn this paper, we investigated the issue of 3D facial ex-\\npression representation and recognition. To the best of our\\nknowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to recognize facial ex-\\npressions using range data in a complete 3D space. We\\nhave proposed to extract and label the primitive 3D surface\\nfeatures, and derive their statistical distributions to repre-\\nsent the distinct prototypic facial expressions. We used the\\nprimitive surface feature distribution (PSFD) as the signa-\\nture to distinguish facial expressions, and conducted expres-sion recognition experiments using the person-independentstrategy. Compared to the existing 2D static image based\\napproaches (e.g., GW and TC methods), our 3D range data\\nbased approach shows superior performance as a result ofthe lighting and orientation invariance of 3D geometric fea-\\ntures. The experiments show encouraging results in recog-nizing six prototypic facial expressions under various head-\\npose conditions.\\nThere are some limitations in the current work:\\n(1)Our current data set contains only static expression\\nmodels. A database including dynamic 3D facial expres-\\nsion sequences is needed in order to study the subtle skin\\nmovement associated with facial expressions in 3D space.\\nWith the emergence of dynamic 3D imaging systems [25],\\nit is possible to investigate the feasibility of tracking action\\nunits in 3D space to further enhance the current FACS based\\nfacial expression recognition technique. Because the dis-\\ncriminability of 3D facial expressions is dependent on the\\nresolution of the 3D mesh, higher resolution models are re-\\nquired in order to improve the recognition performance.\\n(2) The current work involves the pre-processing of\\nrange data which requires manual selection of the surfaceﬁducial points. In order to realize an automatic system for3D facial expression analysis, algorithms for automatic de-tection of 3D surface features must be developed. The exist-\\ning approaches (e.g., free-form based [25], etc.) are promis-\\nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) \\n0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006  IEEE \\n\\ning for this purpose.\\nThe above issues give rise to our future research direc-\\ntions in order to improve facial expression analysis in the\\n3D space. In addition, we will investigate integrating 3D\\ngeometric shape and 2D texture information to improve our\\ncurrent approach.\\n7.

       "      <td>3D Facial Expression Recognition Based on Automatically Selected Features Hao Tang and Thomas S. Huang University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801 fhaotang2,huangg@ifp.uiuc.edu Abstract In this paper, the problem of person-independent fa- cial expression recognition from 3D facial shapes is inves- tigated. We propose a novel automatic feature selection method based on maximizing the average relative entropy of marginalized class-conditional feature distributions and apply it to a complete pool of candidate features composed of normalized Euclidean distances between 83 facial fea- ture points in the 3D space. Using a regularized multi-class AdaBoost classi\u0002cation algorithm, we achieve a 95.1% av- erage recognition rate for six universal facial expressions on the publicly available 3D facial expression database BU- 3DFE [1], with a highest average recognition rate of 99.2% for the recognition of surprise. We compare these results with the results based on a set of manually devised features and demonstrate that the auto features yield better results than the manual features. Our results outperform the re- sults presented in the previous work [2] and [3], namely average recognition rates of 83.6% and 91.3% on the same database, respectively. 1. Introduction 3D facial shapes, which are de\u0002ned by the 3D geometry of the faces of human beings, contain important information about human's facial expressions. Such information is in- variant to pose and lighting conditions, which have imposed serious hurdles on many 2D facial analysis tasks such as 2D facial expression recognition. In light of this, the explo- ration and exploitation of 3D facial geometric information in tackling various facial analysis problems have emerged in the research community. Thanks to the fast-developing and increasingly mature 3D range scanning products and computer vision based techniques for 3D face reconstruc- tion from one or more 2D images, the 3D facial geometric information has been relatively extensively utilized in the study of face recognition [4, 5]. However, unlike in the case of face recognition, far fewer work has been done on facial expression recognition which takes advantage of the 3D facial geometric information. The most obvious reasonfor this embarrassing situation is that there has long been a lack of a publicly available 3D facial expression database to serve as a common platform for the researchers in the \u0002eld. Without such a database, neither can the researchers start with problem investigation nor can they end in comparing their results. Now the good news is, Yin et. al. at Bing- hamton University have recently constructed a 3D facial expression database for facial behavior research and made it publicly available [1]. This is de\u0002nitely the \u0002rst attempt to make a publicly available 3D facial expression database for the research community. It is believed that the existence of this database will have a great impact on the facial behavior relevant research in the next a few years to come. Wang et. al. [2] performed the very \u0002rst work of 3D facial expression recognition on the BU-3DFE database. They reported that the highest average recognition rate they had obtained on this database was 83.6% by using elaborately extracted primitive facial surface features and an LDA classi\u0002er. They also reported that the facial expressions of happiness and surprise were well identi\u0002ed with accuracies of 95% and 90.8%, respectively. They compared their results with the results obtained by two 2D appearance feature based methods, namely the well- known Gabor-wavelet (GW) approach and the Topographic Context (TC) approach. In both cases, they showed that their results outperformed those for the 2D methods. They demonstrated that by incorporating 3D facial geometric information the facial expression recognition problem can be better solved. This is highly expectable because 3D facial shapes contain rich information about facial expressions and are more robust than 2D appearances. Soyel and Demirel [3] also conducted 3D facial expres- sion recognition work on the BU-3DFE database. They applied a carefully tuned neural network architecture to \u0002ve characteristic facial feature distances that represent the eye opening, eyebrow height, mouth opening, mouth height, and lip stretching. They reported that the average recogni- tion rate of their system was 91.3% and the highest average recognition rate reached to 98.3% in the recognition of surprise. As of the writing of this paper, to the best of our knowledge, this is the only work that claims better results 978-1-4244-2340-8/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE .

In this paper, we further investigate the problem of person-independent facial expression recognition from 3D facial shapes based on the BU-3DFE database. We propose a novel automatic feature selection method based on max- imizing the average relative entropy of marginalized class- conditional feature distributions and apply it to a complete pool of candidate features composed of normalized Eu- clidean distances between 83 facial feature points in the 3D space. Using a regularized multi-class AdaBoost classi\u0002ca- tion algorithm with three different weak classi\u0002ers, namely Nearest Neighbor (NN), Naive Bayes (NB), and LDA, we achieve a 95.1% average recognition rate for six universal facial expressions, namely anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The highest average recognition rate that we obtain is 99.2% for the recognition of surprise. We compare these results with the results based on a set of man- ually devised features and demonstrate that the auto features yield better results than the manual features. In addition, we show that our results outperform the results presented in the previous work [2] and [3], namely average recognition rates of 83.6% and 91.3% on the same database, respectively. 2. Database description The BU-3DFE database was recently developed by Yin et. al. at Binghamton University. It was designed to sample 3D facial behaviors with different prototypical emotional states at various levels of intensities. There are a total of 100 subjects in the database. Among these subjects, 56 are female and 44 are male. The subjects are well dis-tributed across different ethnic or racial ancestries, includ- ing White, Black, East-Asian, Middle-East Asian, Hispanic Latino, and others. While being recorded, each subject was asked to perform the neutral facial expression as well as six universal facial expressions, namely anger (AN), dis- gust (DI), fear (FE), happiness (HA), sadness (SA), and sur- prise (SU). Each facial expression has four levels of inten- sities (low, middle, high, highest or 01-04), except that the neutral facial expression has only one intensity level (00). Thus, there are 25 3D facial expression models for each subject, resulting in 2500 3D facial expression models in the database. Associated with a 3D facial expression model are a raw 3D face mesh model, a cropped 3D face mesh model, a pair of texture images with two-angle views (about +45oand - 45oaway from the face frontal normal), a frontal-view tex- ture image, a set of 83 facial feature points, and a facial pose vector. These data give a complete 3D description of a face under a speci\u0002c facial expression. A detailed description of the BU-3DFE database can be found in [1]. In this pa- per, we only use the 83 facial feature points marked on the cropped 3D face mesh model, as shown in (a). We refer to a cropped 3D face mesh model as a 3D facial ex- pression model. Some examples of the 3D facial expression models in the BU-3DFE database are illustrated in . 3. Feature extraction In this paper, we manually devise a set of features (here- after referred to as the manual features, as compared to the automatically selected features, namely the auto features) based on the normalized Euclidean distances between the facial feature points on the 3D facial expression models. According to Ekman [6, 7], the six universal facial expres- sions are coded by combinations of action units, which are caused by the movements of particular facial feature points. Similarly, the MPEG-4 standard [8] speci\u0002es that the six universal facial expressions correspond to six unique fa- cial con\u0002gurations, which can be obtained by adjusting the weights of certain facial animation parameters (FAPs). The FAPs will change the relative position of the facial feature points, resulting in distinct collocation patterns of facial fea- ture points. In light of this, we believe that the distances be- tween certain facial feature points offer a sparse, compact, yet information-rich representation of the 3D facial shape.Such representation is invariant to translations and rotations of the 3D facial geometry. We extract a set of 24 features composed of the nor- malized distances between a subset of the 83 facial feature points. These distances are believed to play an important role in determining the various facial expressions. The 24 features are shown in (b) and their textual descrip- tions are given in . Since the faces of different people tend to have differ- ent sizes and proportions, in order to make the features person-independent, we normalize the distances by facial animation parameter units (FAPUs), as guided by theMPEG-4 standard. In MPEG-4, the FAPUs serve to scale the FAPs in order that a single set of FAPs can be used with arbitrary face models. The FAPUs are de\u0002ned as fractions of distances between certain feature points on a face model in its neutral state and allow us to interpret the FAPs on arbitrary face models in a consistent way. The \u0002ve FAPUs are shown in . The distances are then divided by the corresponding FAPUs, given as the unit in . 4. Automatic feature selection In a typical pattern classi\u0002cation system, the features are generally devised by experts from the domain of the problem. While expert-derived features are often compact and useful, to derive them requires domain knowledge and many trials and errors. An attractive scheme is that we have a large pool of candidate features, which are relatively easy to collect, and we want a computer algorithm to be able to automatically select the best features from this candidate feature pool. In order to perform automatic feature selection, one has to tell the computer algorithm in what sense a feature is considered the best. Since our goal is to classify patterns, the discrimination power comes in naturally. In general, the more discrimination power a feature possesses, the more it will contribute to the classi\u0002cation accuracy. Thus, intu- itively and naturally, we want an automatic feature selection algorithm to select from the candidate pool those features 11 13 1214 23246 41 2 7 8 15169101920212218 173 5 (a) (b) .

From a Bayesian point of view, the discrimination power of a feature vector DP(x)depends on how much discrimi- native information lies in the class-conditional distributions ofx. The more differences that the class-conditional distri- butions exhibit, the more discriminative information there is in x. A good metric that measures the differences be- tween two probability distributions is the relative entropy, or Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) [9].

       "      <td>3D Facial Expression Recognition Based on Primitive Surface Feature Distribution Jun Wang, Lijun Yin, Xiaozhou Wei and Yi Sun Department of Computer Science State University of New Y ork at Binghamton, NY , 13902, USA Abstract The creation of facial range models by 3D imaging sys- tems has led to extensive work on 3D face recognition [19]. However, little work has been done to study the usefulness of such data for recognizing and understanding facial ex-pressions. Psychological research shows that the shape of ahuman face, a highly mobile facial surface, is critical to fa-cial expression perception. In this paper, we investigate theimportance and usefulness of 3D facial geometric shapes to represent and recognize facial expressions using 3D facial expression range data. We propose a novel approach to ex- tract primitive 3D facial expression features, and then apply the feature distribution to classify the prototypic facial ex- pressions. In order to validate our proposed approach, we have conducted experiments for person-independent facial expression recognition using our newly created 3D facial expression database. We also demonstrate the advantages of our 3D geometric based approach over 2D texture based approaches in terms of various head poses. 1. Introduction There is a long history of interest in the problem of rec- ognizing human emotion from facial expressions, as well as extensive studies on face perception over the last threedecades [8, 17]. Analyzing the emotional expression of ahuman face requires a number of preprocessing steps whichattempt to detect and locate characteristic facial regions, ex- tract facial expression features, and model facial gestures using anatomic information about the face. Although all these steps are equally important, current research mostlyconcentrates on the facial expression feature detection anddescription, which is also the focus of this paper. Facial expression features are mainly represented by three categories: (1) static versus dynamic (or temporal);(2) global versus local (or analytic); and (3) 2D versus 3D. Most research over the past thirty years has been di- rected towards static/dynamic, analytic, 2D feature extrac-tion [9], focusing primarily on two types of features: 2D geometric features and appearance features from 2D static images [16, 18] or video sequences [4, 3, 31]. Geomet-ric features are described by a set of facial feature pointsused to derive facial organs’ shapes or expressive regions.Appearance features refer to the features exhibited on the skin (e.g., frowns or wrinkles) [22] or action units [8, 6]. Over the past decade, a number of techniques have been successfully developed for facial expression recognition, in-cluding optical ﬂow [28, 10] and Gabor wavelets [16], andFACS-feature based techniques [22, 1, 6, 31]. The excel-lent review of recent advances in this ﬁeld can be found in [5, 12, 17, 32]. All recent advances have been based on 2D images or videos, and most were primarily concerned with extracting prototypic expressions from frontal or near-frontal views of a face. Recently, additional work has been done to improve the performance of facial expression recognition under vari- ous imaging conditions (e.g., pose, lighting, etc). Some researchers have successfully explored partial 3D informa- tion for facial expression recognition, such as multiple-view based [18] and 3D model-based techniques [2, 13, 27, 30]. These methods are still based on 2D data. Because the facial expression actuated by the facial muscle movement resultsin the facial skin shape variation, it is ideal to model thefacial expressions explicitly in a 3D space. Due to the limitations in describing facial surface defor- mation when 3D features are evaluated in 2D space, 2D images with a group of feature units may not accuratelyreﬂect complex and authentic facial expressions. More im-portantly, head pose and posture, which are precious cues inconjunction with facial action, reﬂect a person’s real emo-tion. Since people rarely express emotions without head motion or posture spontaneity, the assumption of frontalimages of faces under good illumination is to be unreal-istic. Therefore, there is a high demand to represent and recognize facial expressions in 3D space. In this paper, we address the issue regarding 3D global features on the 3Df a - cial surface in order to mitigate the problems posted by 2Dbased facial expression analysis. Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) 0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006 IEEE The3D surface features, reﬂecting the facial skin “wave”, represent the intrinsic facial surface structure as- sociated with the speciﬁc facial expressions. Motivated bythis fact, we propose a novel geometric feature based facialexpression descriptor in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Based on the principal curvature information estimated onthe3D triangle mesh model, we apply a surface labeling approach to classify the 3D primitive surface features into twelve basic categories. In order to classify the speciﬁc ex- pression, we partition the face surface into a number of ex-pressive regions, and conduct the statistics of the surface primitive label distribution on each region separately. The statistic histograms of the surface labels of all these regionsare combined to construct the speciﬁc facial expression fea-ture. Finally, we validate our approach by the recognition ex- periments on our newly constructed 3D facial expression database. We conduct the experiments in the following several aspects: the performance investigation of our 3D approach; the comparison study with 2D appearance fea- ture based methods (Gabor-Wavelet method and our Topo-graphic Context method), including the front view case and the angle-view case. The experiments are executed in a person-independent manner, which means that the subject being tested has never appeared in the training set. We haveselected four classiﬁers for the classiﬁcation experiments.Since the paper focuses on 3D facial expression descrip- tion, the classiﬁcation algorithm design is not expatiated onin this paper. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the surface primitive feature anal-ysis based on the computational geometry method. In Sec-tion 3, we describe the facial expression feature extractionfrom the primitive surface features distribution. Section 4reports the experimental results of the 3D facial expression recognition, followed by a comparison with the 2D appear- ance feature based approaches in Section 5. Finally, con-cluding remarks and discussion are given in Section 6. 2.3D Primitive Feature Analysis The surface feature analysis is based on the triangle meshes of faces, which are created by a 3D imaging system [15]. The system captures a three dimensional point cloudand generates a meshed surface that models the face as 3D triangle mesh geometry. The 3D surface data points are less than300 microns apart, providing the capability of distin- guishing between small differences regardless of lighting or orientation during the original scan. shows an example of 3D facial expression range models with six pro- totypic facial expressions. In the following sub-sections, we will give a detailed description of the primitive facial feature estimation and labeling of the range models. .

Principal Curvature Analysis by Local Surface Fitting The shape information of a surface is “encoded” in its primitive geometric features (such as ridge, ravine, peak,pit, saddle, concave hill, convex hill, etc.), which may be viewed as a digital signature of a facial expression. Thesefeatures are determined by the surface curvatures and theirprincipal directions. Curvature estimation techniques fortriangle meshes could be based on the mesh itself or al- ternatively on a local smooth approximation. In general,there are broadly two categories: discrete and continuous[11]. The ﬁrst refers to approximating curvatures by formu- lating a closed form for differential geometry operators thatwork directly on the discrete representation of the underly-ing surface. The latter involves ﬁtting a surface locally, then computing the curvatures by interrogating the ﬁtted surface. Our experiment shows that curvature estimates derived by locally approximating the surface with a smooth polynomialfunction give better results than the discrete versions. In order to derive the geometry features of facial sur- face, we give an analytic form of the regression functionfor smoothly ﬁtting the triangle mesh surface. Note thatalthough the triangle meshes are deﬁned in a global coordi-nate system, for easy computation, the ﬁtting procedure isperformed in a local coordinate system, which is centered at the vertex to be examined. The local coordinate systemfor the surface ﬁtting is deﬁned as follows: let pbe a vertex on a 3D model M, andn p=(a,b, c)Tbe the unit nor- mal at vertex p. A set of vertices that are adjacent to pis {qi=(xi,yi,zi)T},i=1,2...,m . A local coordinate sys- tem is deﬁned by taking the vertex pas an origin and ( nx, ny,np) as the three axes. nxandnyare two orthogonal axes, which are arbitrarily selected to form a tangent planeperpendicular to the normal vector n pat crossing point p (see for an example). The normal vector can be simply estimated by the mean normal, which is obtained by Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) 0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006 IEEE np v1 v2nx ny xy zp . An example of a local coordinate system (nx,ny,np)deﬁned on a nose surface patch. v1,v2are the principal directions at pointp. the average of normal values of the polygons sharing the common vertex p. To ﬁt a smooth polynomial patch onto the local surface and estimate the principal curvatures, we transform the ver- tices of the local region to the local coordinate system. Theresulting vertices ˜q iand the corresponding normal vectors ˜n˜qiare expressed as: ˜qi=RT·(qi−p) ˜n˜qi=RT·nqi (1) where the rotation matrix is obtained by R=[nxnynp]. The vertex pand its normal npare transformed to the origin ˜p=( 0,0,0)Tand the unit vector ˜np=( 0,0,1)Talong the positive zaxis, respectively. The approximating polynomial surface is at least sec- ond order. Considering the ﬁtting accuracy and the compu-tation complexity, we choose a cubic-order approximationmethod. Similar to the method in [14], we deﬁne the ﬁttingfunction in the form of z(˜x,˜y)=U·X (2) where the variable Uand the coefﬁcient Xare deﬁned as: U=(1 2˜x2˜x˜y1 2˜y2˜x3˜x2˜y˜x˜y2˜y3) X=(ABCDEFG )T(3) Given a set of neighbor vertices {˜qi=( ˜xi,˜yi,˜zi)T}, (i=1,2,..., m )and their corresponding normals {˜n˜qi=(ai,bi,ci)T}, we can establish 3mequations to solve the seven parameters of X. When the vertex phas more than three neighbor vertices, the parameters Xcan be approx- imated using the least-square ﬁtting method. With the re- gressed local ﬁtting function z(˜x,˜y), the Weingarten matrix for the surface patch becomes: W=/bracketleftBigg∂2z(˜x,˜y) ∂˜x2∂2z(˜x,˜y) ∂˜x∂˜y ∂2z(˜x,˜y) ∂˜x∂˜y∂2z(˜x,˜y) ∂˜y2/bracketrightBigg =/bracketleftbiggAB BC/bracketrightbigg (4) After the eigenvalue decomposition, the principal direc- tions in the local coordinates ˜ v1and˜ v2can be estimated. W=(˜ v1˜ v2)·diag(λ1λ2)·(˜ v1˜ v2)T(5) where λ1andλ2are the eigenvalues and ˜ v1and˜ v2are the orthogonal eigenvectors. If |λ1|&gt;|λ2|,˜v1and˜v2are in the directions with the maximum curvature and the minimum curvature, respectively. (a)(b) shows an example ofthe principal direction estimation on a facial range model. Since the principal directions are represented in the local coordinate system, to obtain a global view of the principal directions, ˜ v 1and˜ v2must be rotated back to the global coordinate system, as formulated by v1=R·˜ v1,v2=R·˜ v2 (6) It is worth noting that our surface labeling criteria rely on the surface principal curvatures, the principal directions as well as the surface gradient. After the transformation from the local coordinate system to the original global co-ordinate system, we can derive the gradient using the nor-mal direction of each surface point. Let z(x,y)be the ﬁt- ting function of a surface patch centered at p, the normal direction n p=(a,b, c)Tcan be written in the form of (−∂z(x,y) ∂x,−∂z(x,y) ∂y,−1)T. The gradient magnitude /bardbl∇z(x,y)/bardbl atpis then calculated as: /bardbl∇z(x,y)/bardbl=/radicalBig [∂z(x,y) ∂x]2+[∂z(x,y) ∂x]2=/radicalBig [−a c]2+[−b c]2(7) The principal curvature analysis produced a set of at- tributes {/bardbl∇z/bardbl,v1,v2,λ1,λ2}, which describes the sur- face property at each vertex. Every vertex can be classiﬁed according to a primitive feature classiﬁcation rule, which will be explained in the next sub-section. 2.2. Primitive 3D Surface Feature Labeling The principal curvatures λ1,λ2represent the maximum and the minimum degrees of bending of a surface, v1and v2indicate the surface principal directions, and /bardbl∇z/bardblre- ﬂects the steepness of the surface. Using these geometric attributes, we are able to classify every vertex into one of the primitive categories. In other words, we can symbolize Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) 0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006 IEEE (a) (b) (c) .

This symbolization process can be realized bymapping the primitive surface features from a 3D geometric space to a discrete label space, which is formulated as: Q:{/bardbl∇z/bardbl,v 1,v2,λ1,λ2}=⇒{Lm},m=1,2,..., M (8) where Qis a pre-deﬁned classiﬁcation rule and {Lm}is a set of surface categories with a total of Mtypes to be identiﬁed. There are several existing rules for primitive surface fea- ture classiﬁcation. For example, (1) the shape index basedclassiﬁcation [7]; (2) Tanaka’s method [21], which catego- rized eight distinct features to describe local shapes accord- ing to the sign of two principal curvatures; (3) the topo-graphic classiﬁcation method [23, 26], which has been used for analyzing the 3D topographic surfaces of gray level im- ages. Depending on the classiﬁcation ﬁneness, the maximaltwelve distinct primitive features can be deﬁned. They are peak, pit, ﬂat, ravine, ridge, saddle (including ridge saddle and ravine saddle) and hill (including convex hill, concavehill, concave saddle hill, convex saddle hill and slope hill). In order to scrutinize the facial expression surface de- tails, we use the twelve distinct primitive surface features torepresent the facial expressions. Similar to the classiﬁcation rule used in [23], we extend the method to the application for the real 3D facial surface labeling. The labeling process is based on the feature values of {/bardbl∇z/bardbl,v 1,v2,λ1,λ2}in the global coordinate system. To do so, two thresholds, TG andTλ, are deﬁned. They are used to evaluate whether the gradient magnitude and the principal curvatures are trivial enough to be ignored as zero. The thresholds are calculated based on the mixed error criteria [26]: TG= max[ /epsilon1,/epsilon1·z(x,y)] Tλ= max[ /epsilon1,/epsilon1·/bardblW/bardbl∞] (9) where /bardblW/bardbl∞= max[ |A|+|B|,|B|+|C|](see Equation4) and /epsilon1is a user-speciﬁed parameter. In our method, we use/epsilon1=0.001·s, where sis the average distance from each vertex to the center of the individual 3D facial model. The classiﬁcation rule for twelve primitive surface labels is expounded in . In general, if /bardbl∇z/bardbl&lt;TGor there is a zero crossing in the direction of the maximum curva-ture, one of the non-hillside labels is assigned; otherwise, one of the hill-side labels is assigned using the rule deﬁnedin the table.

Classiﬁcation rule of primitive 3D surface labels. 3. 3D Expression Description Based on Primi- tive Label Distribution After the labeling process, the facial expressions can be described by the distribution of the labels over the local orentire facial region. Intuitively, every facial expression is a result of facial muscle actuation, reﬂecting the facial surface variation. Such a variation results in the different distribu-tions of primitive surface labels. This fact suggests that the primitive label distribution could directly link to a distinct facial expression. In other words, the same type of facial expression is expected to share the similar primitive label distribution with a certain robustness, given a sufﬁcient res-olution of the range model. To ﬁnd an explicit representation of the fundamental structure of facial surface details, we investigate the statisti-cal distributions of the primitive surface labels in seven ex- pressive facial regions, which are deﬁned according to the neuro-anatomy knowledge of conﬁguration of facial mus- cles and their dynamics [20]. As shown in , sixty- four ﬁducial points are deﬁned on the facial surface, and ac-cordingly, the seven expressive local regions are constructed based on these key points. Note that the interiors of mouth and eyes are currently not included in the seven local re- gions. The reasons are twofold: (1) the interiors of mouth and eyes are isolated from the facial skin. They can be Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) 0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006 IEEE (b) (a) . 64facial ﬁducial points and 7se- lected facial regions. treated as three separated objects. These “holes” are com- plementary areas of the facial skin area. The change of their shapes is directly reﬂected on the change of the surroundingskins which have been included in the seven expressive re-gions; (2) although tongues and eye-balls can be viewed asthe signatures of facial expressions, their appearances may not be as stable as the facial skin due to the dark hole effect existing in the current 3D imaging systems. In short, the selected seven local regions cover the most expressive areas on a human face. In each selected region, we identify the expression signature by calculating the his-togram distribution of primitive labels. Such a distributionis described as follows: r i=/bracketleftbiggni1 ni,···,nim ni,···,niM ni/bracketrightbigg (10) where nimis the number of vertices which are labeled by the label type Lm, andniis the total number of vertices in the ith local region ( ni=M/summationtext m=1nim).M=1 2 is the number of the primitive label categories. The combination of seven histogram distributions of the selected entire regions generates a unique expression de- scriptor for a speciﬁc expression. As a result, the expres- sion is described by the primitive surface feature distribu-tion (PSFD), which is expressed by E=[r 1,···,ri,···,rK] (11) where Kis the number of expressive regions ( K=7in our experiment). 4. Recognition Experiments 4.1. Database We constructed a 3D facial expression database for our experiment. The 3D range data is scanned by a 3DMD static digitizer [15], which uses a random light pattern projectionin the speckle projection ﬂash environment . The modelresolution is in the range of 20,000 polygons to 35,000 polygons, depending on the size of the face being scanned.The facial expressions with six universal emotional states, Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness and Surprise , are sampled in four different levels of intensity (e.g., from lesspronounced to more pronounced). In our experiment, we used the data captured from 60subjects with two high- intensity models for each expression. The test is based onthe six prototypic expressions. Each range facial model consists of a meshed surface model and an associated texture image. The head pose can be estimated by a triangle plane determined by the in- ner corners of two eyes and a nose tip. Given the head pose, the original scan is processed by rotating the model to the frontal view. This pre-processing results in a work- ing model , on which we manually labeled 64ﬁdicual ver- tices for the expression recognition experiments. gives a summary of the data set that we used for our exper- iments.

Recognition Results Our facial expression recognition experiments are car- ried out in a person-independent manner, which is believed to be more challenging than a person-dependent approach [17]. We randomly partitioned the 60subjects into two sub- sets: one with 54subjects for training and the other with 6subjects for test. The experimental paradigm guarantees that any subject used for testing does not appear in the train-ing set because the random partition is based on the subjectsrather than the individual expression. Four popular clas- siﬁers: Quadratic Discriminant Classiﬁer (QDC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naive Bayesian Classiﬁer (NBC), and Support V ector Classiﬁer (SVC) with RBF ker- nel are used in the experiments. The tests are executed 20 times on each classiﬁer with different partitions to achieve a stable generalization recognition rate. The entire process guarantees that every subject is tested at least once for each classiﬁer. For each round of the test, all the classiﬁers are reset and re-trained from the initial state.

Comparison Study In this section, we compare the proposed 3D primitive feature distribution method (3D-PSFD) with two 2D ap- pearance feature based methods. One is the well-knownGabor-wavelet (GW) approach [16] and the other is our re- cently developed Topographic Context (TC) approach [24]. (1) In the Gabor-wavelet (GW) based approach, a set of multi-scale and multi-orientation coefﬁcients are calculated to describe the appearance variations in the facial region. We applied 6×3complex Gabor-wavelet ( 6orientations and 3spatial resolutions) on 34ﬁducial points. The coefﬁcients of the real and imaginary parts can be computed as: G+(x,y;ω,θ)=ω2 σ2·e−ω2(x2+y2) 2σ2·{cos[ω(xcosθ+ysinθ)]−e−σ2 2} G−(x,y;ω,θ)=ω2 σ2·e−ω2(x2+y2) 2σ2·sin[ω(xcosθ+ysinθ)] (12)where we let σ=π. The three selected spatial scales are{π/4,π/8,π/16}and the 6orientations selected are {0,π/6,π/3,π/2,2π/3,5π/6}. The feature extracted at pixel(x,y)by a certain Gabor-wavelet kernel with parame- ters{ω,θ}is the amplitude of the real and imaginary coef- ﬁcients G=/radicalBig G2 ++G2−. Therefore in total, we extracted 18×34 = 612 wavelet features for each image. (2) In our existing work, we developed a Topographic Context (TC) based approach for facial expression recog- nition based on 2D static images. The TC expression fea- tures are the topographic primal sketch features inherent inthe2D facial images. We use such appearance features to describe the distinct facial expressions. Similar to our 3D based approach, we used the feature statistics to representthe2D facial expressions. It has proved to be robust to fa- cial landmark detection as a result of its intrinsic statisticsproperty (see details in [24]). The comparison study with the above two methods is conducted under various head pose conditions, including two cases: frontal view and non-frontal views. 5.1. Case 1: Frontal View Our frontal-view images are generated from the texture- mapped working models. All these images are normalized to256×256 pixels. Several examples are shown in the top row of . There are 60subjects with a total of 720 frontal-view facial images used for the test. The experi- ments are executed in a person-independent manner similar to the strategy used in Section 4.2. reports the correct recognition rates using these two methods. We found the Gabor-wavelet approach per- forms poorly when using the SVC classiﬁer, which is not comparable to the results from the other three classiﬁers.

Comparing to the performance shown in , the 3D-PSFD method is superior to the 2D appearance feature based methods when classifying the six prototypic facial ex- pressions. 5.2. Case 2: Non-frontal View In this section, we compare the performance of our 3D geometric based approach (PSFD) with the 2D appearance Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) 0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006 IEEE feature based approaches under different head pose condi- tions. We obtained the head pose information from the orig- inal face scans by estimating the triangle face-plane formed by the inner corners of two eyes and the tip of nose. Know- ing the 3D head pose, we are able to rotate the 3D model to a frontal view position or arbitrary pose positions without los- ing any geometric feature information. However, if viewedin the 2D projection plane, the appearance of 2D facial im- ages varies dramatically when the head pose is arbitrarilychanged. The difﬁculty to recover the missing appearanceinformation from 2D images makes 2D based facial expres- sion recognition sensitive to head pose variations. Using our face range models, we have generated facial expression images under different views, corresponding todifferent head poses. This is done by rotating the models to a certain degree and generating the face images in that view by texture-mapping. We generated the face images underviews of ±10 ◦,±20◦,±30◦, and±40◦for each orienta- tion (pitch and yaw rotation), resulting in 720 images for each view. shows the examples of different facial appearances under different views. . Facial expression images with dif- ferent head rotation. Top row is yaw rotation and bottom row is pitch rotation. From left to right, the rotation angle is −40◦,−30◦,−20◦, 20◦,30◦and40◦. We choose to use the LDA classiﬁer to evaluate the expression recognition performance under different head poses because in most cases LDA outputs the best recog- nition result. For all three algorithms (PSFD, GW, and TC), the LDA classiﬁer is trained using the front view face data. The recognition results with respect to different poses (e.g., pitch and yaw rotations) are shown in . From the ﬁgure, we can see that the average recognition rates of the 2D appearance feature based methods degrade con- siderably as head rotation increases, especially the Gabor-wavelet method. The extraction of Gabor-wavelet coefﬁ- cients is based on the selected ﬁducial points. The posechange alters the distribution of these ﬁducial points, and re- sults in signiﬁcant distortion of Gabor-wavelet features. On the contrary, the 3D-PSFD based approach makes the 3D primitive feature distribution invariant to the pose variations because the 3D geometric features are view-independent. .

Concluding Remarks In this paper, we investigated the issue of 3D facial ex- pression representation and recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to recognize facial ex- pressions using range data in a complete 3D space. We have proposed to extract and label the primitive 3D surface features, and derive their statistical distributions to repre- sent the distinct prototypic facial expressions. We used the primitive surface feature distribution (PSFD) as the signa- ture to distinguish facial expressions, and conducted expres-sion recognition experiments using the person-independentstrategy. Compared to the existing 2D static image based approaches (e.g., GW and TC methods), our 3D range data based approach shows superior performance as a result ofthe lighting and orientation invariance of 3D geometric fea- tures. The experiments show encouraging results in recog-nizing six prototypic facial expressions under various head- pose conditions. There are some limitations in the current work: (1)Our current data set contains only static expression models. A database including dynamic 3D facial expres- sion sequences is needed in order to study the subtle skin movement associated with facial expressions in 3D space. With the emergence of dynamic 3D imaging systems [25], it is possible to investigate the feasibility of tracking action units in 3D space to further enhance the current FACS based facial expression recognition technique. Because the dis- criminability of 3D facial expressions is dependent on the resolution of the 3D mesh, higher resolution models are re- quired in order to improve the recognition performance. (2) The current work involves the pre-processing of range data which requires manual selection of the surfaceﬁducial points. In order to realize an automatic system for3D facial expression analysis, algorithms for automatic de-tection of 3D surface features must be developed. The exist- ing approaches (e.g., free-form based [25], etc.) are promis- Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) 0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006 IEEE ing for this purpose. The above issues give rise to our future research direc- tions in order to improve facial expression analysis in the 3D space. In addition, we will investigate integrating 3D geometric shape and 2D texture information to improve our current approach. 7.

Using amulti-class sup- portvector machine (SVM) classi\u0002er ,weachie vean87.1% average recognition rate. The highest average recognition rateobtained is99.2% fortherecognition ofsurprise. 2.Database description TheBU-3DFE database wasrecently developed byYin et.al.atBinghamton University .Itwasdesigned tosample 3Dfacial beha viors with different prototypical emotional states atvarious levelsofintensities. Inthedatabase, there areatotal of100subjects, among which 56arefemale and 44aremale. These subjects arewell distrib uted across dif- ferent ethnic orracial ancestries, including White, Black, East-Asian, Middle-East Asian, Hispanic Latino, andoth- ers. While being recorded, each subject wasaskedtoper- form theneutral facial expression aswell assixuniversalfacial expressions, namely anger (AN), disgust (DI), fear (FE), happiness (HA), sadness (SA), and surprise (SU). Each facial expression hasfour different levelsofintensi- ties(low,middle, high, highest), except thattheneutral fa- cialexpression hasonly oneintensity level.Thus, there are 253Dfacial expression models foreach subject, resulting in2500 3Dfacial expression models inthedatabase. Associated with each 3Dfacial expression model area raw3Dfacemesh model, acropped 3Dfacemesh model, apairoftexture images with two-angle views(about +45o and-45oawayfrom thefacefrontal normal), afrontal-vie w texture image, asetof83facial feature points, andafa- cialpose vector .These data giveacomplete 3Ddescription ofafaceunder aspeci\u0002c facial expression. Adetailed de- scription oftheBU-3DFE database canbefound in[1].In thispaper ,webase ourmethod solely onthe83facial fea- turepoints mark edonthecropped 3Dfacemesh model, as shownin.Wehereafter refer toacropped 3Dface mesh model asa3Dfacial expression model. Some exam- ples ofthe3Dfacial expression models intheBU-3DFE database areillustrated in. .The83facial feature points. 3.Featur eextraction Inthispaper ,wecarefully devise asetoffeatures based onproperties ofthelinesegments connecting certain facial feature points onthe3Dfacial expression models. Accord- ingtoEkman' sfacial action coding system (FACS)[11,12], thesixuniversal facial expressions canbeencoded byac- tion units, which describe themovements ofparticular fa- cialfeature points. Similarly ,intheMPEG-4 standard [13], thesixfacial expressions arede\u0002ned byfacial animation parameters (FAPs), which specify precisely howmuch the facial feature points havetobemoved.Inlight ofthis, we belie vethatcertain properties ofthelinesegments connect- ingfacial feature points offerasparse, compact, anduseful representation ofthe3Dfacial geometry . Wetherefore extract asetof96features, which consist ofthenormalized distances andslopes ofthelinesegments connecting asubset ofthe83facial feature points. These features arebelie vedtoplay animportant roleindetermin- ingthevarious facial expressions. The features arepicto- rially showninandtheir textual descriptions are givenin. Since thefaces ofdifferent people havedifferent sizes and proportions, inorder tomakethefeatures person- independent, wenormalize thedistance features byfa- cialanimation parameter units (FAPUs), asguided bythe MPEG-4 standard. InMPEG-4, theFAPUs servetoscale theFAPs inorder thatasingle setofFAPs canbeused with arbitrary facemodels. TheFAPUs arede\u0002ned asfractions ofdistances between certain feature points onafacemodel initsneutral state andallowtointerpret theFAPs onar- bitrary facemodels inaconsistent way.The \u0002veFAPUs areshownin.The distance features aredivided bythecorresponding FAPUs, givenastheunitin. Inaddition, theslope features (each ofwhich being a3- dimensional vector) aredivided bytheir respecti venorms, resulting inunitvectors. 11 13 1214 23246 41 2 7 8 15169101920212218 173 5 2825 26 2930 3940 46 4527 3132333435363837 4142 4344 4748 (a) (b) .(a)Thedistance features.

Huang University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801 fhaotang2,huangg@ifp.uiuc.edu Abstract In this paper, the problem of person-independent fa- cial expression recognition from 3D facial shapes is inves- tigated. We propose a novel automatic feature selection method based on maximizing the average relative entropy of marginalized class-conditional feature distributions and apply it to a complete pool of candidate features composed of normalized Euclidean distances between 83 facial fea- ture points in the 3D space. Using a regularized multi-class AdaBoost classi\u0002cation algorithm, we achieve a 95.1% av- erage recognition rate for six universal facial expressions on the publicly available 3D facial expression database BU- 3DFE [1], with a highest average recognition rate of 99.2% for the recognition of surprise. We compare these results with the results based on a set of manually devised features and demonstrate that the auto features yield better results than the manual features. Our results outperform the re- sults presented in the previous work [2] and [3], namely average recognition rates of 83.6% and 91.3% on the same database, respectively. 1. Introduction 3D facial shapes, which are de\u0002ned by the 3D geometry of the faces of human beings, contain important information about human's facial expressions. Such information is in- variant to pose and lighting conditions, which have imposed serious hurdles on many 2D facial analysis tasks such as 2D facial expression recognition. In light of this, the explo- ration and exploitation of 3D facial geometric information in tackling various facial analysis problems have emerged in the research community. Thanks to the fast-developing and increasingly mature 3D range scanning products and computer vision based techniques for 3D face reconstruc- tion from one or more 2D images, the 3D facial geometric information has been relatively extensively utilized in the study of face recognition [4, 5]. However, unlike in the case of face recognition, far fewer work has been done on facial expression recognition which takes advantage of the 3D facial geometric information. The most obvious reasonfor this embarrassing situation is that there has long been a lack of a publicly available 3D facial expression database to serve as a common platform for the researchers in the \u0002eld. Without such a database, neither can the researchers start with problem investigation nor can they end in comparing their results. Now the good news is, Yin et. al. at Bing- hamton University have recently constructed a 3D facial expression database for facial behavior research and made it publicly available [1]. This is de\u0002nitely the \u0002rst attempt to make a publicly available 3D facial expression database for the research community. It is believed that the existence of this database will have a great impact on the facial behavior relevant research in the next a few years to come. Wang et. al. [2] performed the very \u0002rst work of 3D facial expression recognition on the BU-3DFE database. They reported that the highest average recognition rate they had obtained on this database was 83.6% by using elaborately extracted primitive facial surface features and an LDA classi\u0002er. They also reported that the facial expressions of happiness and surprise were well identi\u0002ed with accuracies of 95% and 90.8%, respectively. They compared their results with the results obtained by two 2D appearance feature based methods, namely the well- known Gabor-wavelet (GW) approach and the Topographic Context (TC) approach. In both cases, they showed that their results outperformed those for the 2D methods. They demonstrated that by incorporating 3D facial geometric information the facial expression recognition problem can be better solved. This is highly expectable because 3D facial shapes contain rich information about facial expressions and are more robust than 2D appearances. Soyel and Demirel [3] also conducted 3D facial expres- sion recognition work on the BU-3DFE database. They applied a carefully tuned neural network architecture to \u0002ve characteristic facial feature distances that represent the eye opening, eyebrow height, mouth opening, mouth height, and lip stretching. They reported that the average recogni- tion rate of their system was 91.3% and the highest average recognition rate reached to 98.3% in the recognition of surprise. As of the writing of this paper, to the best of our knowledge, this is the only work that claims better results 978-1-4244-2340-8/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE .

In this paper, we further investigate the problem of person-independent facial expression recognition from 3D facial shapes based on the BU-3DFE database. We propose a novel automatic feature selection method based on max- imizing the average relative entropy of marginalized class- conditional feature distributions and apply it to a complete pool of candidate features composed of normalized Eu- clidean distances between 83 facial feature points in the 3D space. Using a regularized multi-class AdaBoost classi\u0002ca- tion algorithm with three different weak classi\u0002ers, namely Nearest Neighbor (NN), Naive Bayes (NB), and LDA, we achieve a 95.1% average recognition rate for six universal facial expressions, namely anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The highest average recognition rate that we obtain is 99.2% for the recognition of surprise. We compare these results with the results based on a set of man- ually devised features and demonstrate that the auto features yield better results than the manual features. In addition, we show that our results outperform the results presented in the previous work [2] and [3], namely average recognition rates of 83.6% and 91.3% on the same database, respectively. 2. Database description The BU-3DFE database was recently developed by Yin et. al. at Binghamton University. It was designed to sample 3D facial behaviors with different prototypical emotional states at various levels of intensities. There are a total of 100 subjects in the database. Among these subjects, 56 are female and 44 are male. The subjects are well dis-tributed across different ethnic or racial ancestries, includ- ing White, Black, East-Asian, Middle-East Asian, Hispanic Latino, and others. While being recorded, each subject was asked to perform the neutral facial expression as well as six universal facial expressions, namely anger (AN), dis- gust (DI), fear (FE), happiness (HA), sadness (SA), and sur- prise (SU). Each facial expression has four levels of inten- sities (low, middle, high, highest or 01-04), except that the neutral facial expression has only one intensity level (00). Thus, there are 25 3D facial expression models for each subject, resulting in 2500 3D facial expression models in the database. Associated with a 3D facial expression model are a raw 3D face mesh model, a cropped 3D face mesh model, a pair of texture images with two-angle views (about +45oand - 45oaway from the face frontal normal), a frontal-view tex- ture image, a set of 83 facial feature points, and a facial pose vector. These data give a complete 3D description of a face under a speci\u0002c facial expression. A detailed description of the BU-3DFE database can be found in [1]. In this pa- per, we only use the 83 facial feature points marked on the cropped 3D face mesh model, as shown in (a). We refer to a cropped 3D face mesh model as a 3D facial ex- pression model. Some examples of the 3D facial expression models in the BU-3DFE database are illustrated in . 3. Feature extraction In this paper, we manually devise a set of features (here- after referred to as the manual features, as compared to the automatically selected features, namely the auto features) based on the normalized Euclidean distances between the facial feature points on the 3D facial expression models. According to Ekman [6, 7], the six universal facial expres- sions are coded by combinations of action units, which are caused by the movements of particular facial feature points. Similarly, the MPEG-4 standard [8] speci\u0002es that the six universal facial expressions correspond to six unique fa- cial con\u0002gurations, which can be obtained by adjusting the weights of certain facial animation parameters (FAPs). The FAPs will change the relative position of the facial feature points, resulting in distinct collocation patterns of facial fea- ture points. In light of this, we believe that the distances be- tween certain facial feature points offer a sparse, compact, yet information-rich representation of the 3D facial shape.Such representation is invariant to translations and rotations of the 3D facial geometry. We extract a set of 24 features composed of the nor- malized distances between a subset of the 83 facial feature points. These distances are believed to play an important role in determining the various facial expressions. The 24 features are shown in (b) and their textual descrip- tions are given in . Since the faces of different people tend to have differ- ent sizes and proportions, in order to make the features person-independent, we normalize the distances by facial animation parameter units (FAPUs), as guided by theMPEG-4 standard. In MPEG-4, the FAPUs serve to scale the FAPs in order that a single set of FAPs can be used with arbitrary face models. The FAPUs are de\u0002ned as fractions of distances between certain feature points on a face model in its neutral state and allow us to interpret the FAPs on arbitrary face models in a consistent way. The \u0002ve FAPUs are shown in . The distances are then divided by the corresponding FAPUs, given as the unit in . 4. Automatic feature selection In a typical pattern classi\u0002cation system, the features are generally devised by experts from the domain of the problem. While expert-derived features are often compact and useful, to derive them requires domain knowledge and many trials and errors. An attractive scheme is that we have a large pool of candidate features, which are relatively easy to collect, and we want a computer algorithm to be able to automatically select the best features from this candidate feature pool. In order to perform automatic feature selection, one has to tell the computer algorithm in what sense a feature is considered the best. Since our goal is to classify patterns, the discrimination power comes in naturally. In general, the more discrimination power a feature possesses, the more it will contribute to the classi\u0002cation accuracy. Thus, intu- itively and naturally, we want an automatic feature selection algorithm to select from the candidate pool those features 11 13 1214 23246 41 2 7 8 15169101920212218 173 5 (a) (b) .

From a Bayesian point of view, the discrimination power of a feature vector DP(x)depends on how much discrimi- native information lies in the class-conditional distributions ofx. The more differences that the class-conditional distri- butions exhibit, the more discriminative information there is in x.

       "2  3D Facial Expression Recognition Based on Primitive Surface Feature Distribution Jun Wang, Lijun Yin, Xiaozhou Wei and Yi Sun Department of Computer Science State University of New Y ork at Binghamton, NY , 13902, USA Abstract The creation of facial range models by 3D imaging sys- tems has led to extensive work on 3D face recognition [19]. However, little work has been done to study the usefulness of such data for recognizing and understanding facial ex-pressions. Psychological research shows that the shape of ahuman face, a highly mobile facial surface, is critical to fa-cial expression perception. In this paper, we investigate theimportance and usefulness of 3D facial geometric shapes to represent and recognize facial expressions using 3D facial expression range data. We propose a novel approach to ex- tract primitive 3D facial expression features, and then apply the feature distribution to classify the prototypic facial ex- pressions. In order to validate our proposed approach, we have conducted experiments for person-independent facial expression recognition using our newly created 3D facial expression database. We also demonstrate the advantages of our 3D geometric based approach over 2D texture based approaches in terms of various head poses. 1. Introduction There is a long history of interest in the problem of rec- ognizing human emotion from facial expressions, as well as extensive studies on face perception over the last threedecades [8, 17]. Analyzing the emotional expression of ahuman face requires a number of preprocessing steps whichattempt to detect and locate characteristic facial regions, ex- tract facial expression features, and model facial gestures using anatomic information about the face. Although all these steps are equally important, current research mostlyconcentrates on the facial expression feature detection anddescription, which is also the focus of this paper. Facial expression features are mainly represented by three categories: (1) static versus dynamic (or temporal);(2) global versus local (or analytic); and (3) 2D versus 3D. Most research over the past thirty years has been di- rected towards static/dynamic, analytic, 2D feature extrac-tion [9], focusing primarily on two types of features: 2D geometric features and appearance features from 2D static images [16, 18] or video sequences [4, 3, 31]. Geomet-ric features are described by a set of facial feature pointsused to derive facial organs’ shapes or expressive regions.Appearance features refer to the features exhibited on the skin (e.g., frowns or wrinkles) [22] or action units [8, 6]. Over the past decade, a number of techniques have been successfully developed for facial expression recognition, in-cluding optical ﬂow [28, 10] and Gabor wavelets [16], andFACS-feature based techniques [22, 1, 6, 31]. The excel-lent review of recent advances in this ﬁeld can be found in [5, 12, 17, 32]. All recent advances have been based on 2D images or videos, and most were primarily concerned with extracting prototypic expressions from frontal or near-frontal views of a face. Recently, additional work has been done to improve the performance of facial expression recognition under vari- ous imaging conditions (e.g., pose, lighting, etc). Some researchers have successfully explored partial 3D informa- tion for facial expression recognition, such as multiple-view based [18] and 3D model-based techniques [2, 13, 27, 30]. These methods are still based on 2D data. Because the facial expression actuated by the facial muscle movement resultsin the facial skin shape variation, it is ideal to model thefacial expressions explicitly in a 3D space. Due to the limitations in describing facial surface defor- mation when 3D features are evaluated in 2D space, 2D images with a group of feature units may not accuratelyreﬂect complex and authentic facial expressions. More im-portantly, head pose and posture, which are precious cues inconjunction with facial action, reﬂect a person’s real emo-tion. Since people rarely express emotions without head motion or posture spontaneity, the assumption of frontalimages of faces under good illumination is to be unreal-istic. Therefore, there is a high demand to represent and recognize facial expressions in 3D space. In this paper, we address the issue regarding 3D global features on the 3Df a - cial surface in order to mitigate the problems posted by 2Dbased facial expression analysis. Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) 0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006 IEEE The3D surface features, reﬂecting the facial skin “wave”, represent the intrinsic facial surface structure as- sociated with the speciﬁc facial expressions. Motivated bythis fact, we propose a novel geometric feature based facialexpression descriptor in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Based on the principal curvature information estimated onthe3D triangle mesh model, we apply a surface labeling approach to classify the 3D primitive surface features into twelve basic categories. In order to classify the speciﬁc ex- pression, we partition the face surface into a number of ex-pressive regions, and conduct the statistics of the surface primitive label distribution on each region separately. The statistic histograms of the surface labels of all these regionsare combined to construct the speciﬁc facial expression fea-ture. Finally, we validate our approach by the recognition ex- periments on our newly constructed 3D facial expression database. We conduct the experiments in the following several aspects: the performance investigation of our 3D approach; the comparison study with 2D appearance fea- ture based methods (Gabor-Wavelet method and our Topo-graphic Context method), including the front view case and the angle-view case. The experiments are executed in a person-independent manner, which means that the subject being tested has never appeared in the training set. We haveselected four classiﬁers for the classiﬁcation experiments.Since the paper focuses on 3D facial expression descrip- tion, the classiﬁcation algorithm design is not expatiated onin this paper. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the surface primitive feature anal-ysis based on the computational geometry method. In Sec-tion 3, we describe the facial expression feature extractionfrom the primitive surface features distribution. Section 4reports the experimental results of the 3D facial expression recognition, followed by a comparison with the 2D appear- ance feature based approaches in Section 5. Finally, con-cluding remarks and discussion are given in Section 6. 2.3D Primitive Feature Analysis The surface feature analysis is based on the triangle meshes of faces, which are created by a 3D imaging system [15]. The system captures a three dimensional point cloudand generates a meshed surface that models the face as 3D triangle mesh geometry. The 3D surface data points are less than300 microns apart, providing the capability of distin- guishing between small differences regardless of lighting or orientation during the original scan. shows an example of 3D facial expression range models with six pro- totypic facial expressions. In the following sub-sections, we will give a detailed description of the primitive facial feature estimation and labeling of the range models. .

Principal Curvature Analysis by Local Surface Fitting The shape information of a surface is “encoded” in its primitive geometric features (such as ridge, ravine, peak,pit, saddle, concave hill, convex hill, etc.), which may be viewed as a digital signature of a facial expression. Thesefeatures are determined by the surface curvatures and theirprincipal directions. Curvature estimation techniques fortriangle meshes could be based on the mesh itself or al- ternatively on a local smooth approximation. In general,there are broadly two categories: discrete and continuous[11]. The ﬁrst refers to approximating curvatures by formu- lating a closed form for differential geometry operators thatwork directly on the discrete representation of the underly-ing surface. The latter involves ﬁtting a surface locally, then computing the curvatures by interrogating the ﬁtted surface. Our experiment shows that curvature estimates derived by locally approximating the surface with a smooth polynomialfunction give better results than the discrete versions. In order to derive the geometry features of facial sur- face, we give an analytic form of the regression functionfor smoothly ﬁtting the triangle mesh surface. Note thatalthough the triangle meshes are deﬁned in a global coordi-nate system, for easy computation, the ﬁtting procedure isperformed in a local coordinate system, which is centered at the vertex to be examined. The local coordinate systemfor the surface ﬁtting is deﬁned as follows: let pbe a vertex on a 3D model M, andn p=(a,b, c)Tbe the unit nor- mal at vertex p. A set of vertices that are adjacent to pis {qi=(xi,yi,zi)T},i=1,2...,m . A local coordinate sys- tem is deﬁned by taking the vertex pas an origin and ( nx, ny,np) as the three axes. nxandnyare two orthogonal axes, which are arbitrarily selected to form a tangent planeperpendicular to the normal vector n pat crossing point p (see for an example). The normal vector can be simply estimated by the mean normal, which is obtained by Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) 0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006 IEEE np v1 v2nx ny xy zp .

Theresulting vertices ˜q iand the corresponding normal vectors ˜n˜qiare expressed as: ˜qi=RT·(qi−p) ˜n˜qi=RT·nqi (1) where the rotation matrix is obtained by R=[nxnynp]. The vertex pand its normal npare transformed to the origin ˜p=( 0,0,0)Tand the unit vector ˜np=( 0,0,1)Talong the positive zaxis, respectively. The approximating polynomial surface is at least sec- ond order. Considering the ﬁtting accuracy and the compu-tation complexity, we choose a cubic-order approximationmethod. Similar to the method in [14], we deﬁne the ﬁttingfunction in the form of z(˜x,˜y)=U·X (2) where the variable Uand the coefﬁcient Xare deﬁned as: U=(1 2˜x2˜x˜y1 2˜y2˜x3˜x2˜y˜x˜y2˜y3) X=(ABCDEFG )T(3) Given a set of neighbor vertices {˜qi=( ˜xi,˜yi,˜zi)T}, (i=1,2,..., m )and their corresponding normals {˜n˜qi=(ai,bi,ci)T}, we can establish 3mequations to solve the seven parameters of X. When the vertex phas more than three neighbor vertices, the parameters Xcan be approx- imated using the least-square ﬁtting method. With the re- gressed local ﬁtting function z(˜x,˜y), the Weingarten matrix for the surface patch becomes: W=/bracketleftBigg∂2z(˜x,˜y) ∂˜x2∂2z(˜x,˜y) ∂˜x∂˜y ∂2z(˜x,˜y) ∂˜x∂˜y∂2z(˜x,˜y) ∂˜y2/bracketrightBigg =/bracketleftbiggAB BC/bracketrightbigg (4) After the eigenvalue decomposition, the principal direc- tions in the local coordinates ˜ v1and˜ v2can be estimated. W=(˜ v1˜ v2)·diag(λ1λ2)·(˜ v1˜ v2)T(5) where λ1andλ2are the eigenvalues and ˜ v1and˜ v2are the orthogonal eigenvectors. If |λ1|>|λ2|,˜v1and˜v2are in the directions with the maximum curvature and the minimum curvature, respectively. (a)(b) shows an example ofthe principal direction estimation on a facial range model. Since the principal directions are represented in the local coordinate system, to obtain a global view of the principal directions, ˜ v 1and˜ v2must be rotated back to the global coordinate system, as formulated by v1=R·˜ v1,v2=R·˜ v2 (6) It is worth noting that our surface labeling criteria rely on the surface principal curvatures, the principal directions as well as the surface gradient. After the transformation from the local coordinate system to the original global co-ordinate system, we can derive the gradient using the nor-mal direction of each surface point. Let z(x,y)be the ﬁt- ting function of a surface patch centered at p, the normal direction n p=(a,b, c)Tcan be written in the form of (−∂z(x,y) ∂x,−∂z(x,y) ∂y,−1)T. The gradient magnitude /bardbl∇z(x,y)/bardbl atpis then calculated as: /bardbl∇z(x,y)/bardbl=/radicalBig [∂z(x,y) ∂x]2+[∂z(x,y) ∂x]2=/radicalBig [−a c]2+[−b c]2(7) The principal curvature analysis produced a set of at- tributes {/bardbl∇z/bardbl,v1,v2,λ1,λ2}, which describes the sur- face property at each vertex. Every vertex can be classiﬁed according to a primitive feature classiﬁcation rule, which will be explained in the next sub-section. 2.2. Primitive 3D Surface Feature Labeling The principal curvatures λ1,λ2represent the maximum and the minimum degrees of bending of a surface, v1and v2indicate the surface principal directions, and /bardbl∇z/bardblre- ﬂects the steepness of the surface. Using these geometric attributes, we are able to classify every vertex into one of the primitive categories. In other words, we can symbolize Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) 0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006 IEEE (a) (b) (c) . From left to right: minimum curva- ture direction map, maximum curvature di-rection map and primitive label map. the geometric surface by classifying and labeling the primi-tive features. This symbolization process can be realized bymapping the primitive surface features from a 3D geometric space to a discrete label space, which is formulated as: Q:{/bardbl∇z/bardbl,v 1,v2,λ1,λ2}=⇒{Lm},m=1,2,..., M (8) where Qis a pre-deﬁned classiﬁcation rule and {Lm}is a set of surface categories with a total of Mtypes to be identiﬁed. There are several existing rules for primitive surface fea- ture classiﬁcation. For example, (1) the shape index basedclassiﬁcation [7]; (2) Tanaka’s method [21], which catego- rized eight distinct features to describe local shapes accord- ing to the sign of two principal curvatures; (3) the topo-graphic classiﬁcation method [23, 26], which has been used for analyzing the 3D topographic surfaces of gray level im- ages. Depending on the classiﬁcation ﬁneness, the maximaltwelve distinct primitive features can be deﬁned. They are peak, pit, ﬂat, ravine, ridge, saddle (including ridge saddle and ravine saddle) and hill (including convex hill, concavehill, concave saddle hill, convex saddle hill and slope hill). In order to scrutinize the facial expression surface de- tails, we use the twelve distinct primitive surface features torepresent the facial expressions. Similar to the classiﬁcation rule used in [23], we extend the method to the application for the real 3D facial surface labeling. The labeling process is based on the feature values of {/bardbl∇z/bardbl,v 1,v2,λ1,λ2}in the global coordinate system. To do so, two thresholds, TG andTλ, are deﬁned. They are used to evaluate whether the gradient magnitude and the principal curvatures are trivial enough to be ignored as zero. The thresholds are calculated based on the mixed error criteria [26]: TG= max[ /epsilon1,/epsilon1·z(x,y)] Tλ= max[ /epsilon1,/epsilon1·/bardblW/bardbl∞] (9) where /bardblW/bardbl∞= max[ |A|+|B|,|B|+|C|](see Equation4) and /epsilon1is a user-speciﬁed parameter. In our method, we use/epsilon1=0.001·s, where sis the average distance from each vertex to the center of the individual 3D facial model. The classiﬁcation rule for twelve primitive surface labels is expounded in . In general, if /bardbl∇z/bardbl<TGor there is a zero crossing in the direction of the maximum curva-ture, one of the non-hillside labels is assigned; otherwise, one of the hill-side labels is assigned using the rule deﬁnedin the table. (c) shows an example of the labeling result from a 3D facial expression range model. λ1 λ2 Hillside Label Non-Hillside Label |λ1|<Tλ |λ2|<Tλ ﬂat slope hill λ1<−Tλ λ2<−Tλ peak convex hill λ1<−Tλ |λ2|<Tλ ridge convex hill λ1<−Tλ λ2>Tλ ridge saddle convex saddle hill λ1>Tλ λ2<−Tλ ravine saddle concave hill λ1>Tλ |λ2|<Tλ ravine convex hill λ1>Tλ λ2>Tλ pit λ1>Tλ λ2<−Tλ concave saddle hill . Classiﬁcation rule of primitive 3D surface labels. 3. 3D Expression Description Based on Primi- tive Label Distribution After the labeling process, the facial expressions can be described by the distribution of the labels over the local orentire facial region. Intuitively, every facial expression is a result of facial muscle actuation, reﬂecting the facial surface variation. Such a variation results in the different distribu-tions of primitive surface labels. This fact suggests that the primitive label distribution could directly link to a distinct facial expression. In other words, the same type of facial expression is expected to share the similar primitive label distribution with a certain robustness, given a sufﬁcient res-olution of the range model. To ﬁnd an explicit representation of the fundamental structure of facial surface details, we investigate the statisti-cal distributions of the primitive surface labels in seven ex- pressive facial regions, which are deﬁned according to the neuro-anatomy knowledge of conﬁguration of facial mus- cles and their dynamics [20]. As shown in , sixty- four ﬁducial points are deﬁned on the facial surface, and ac-cordingly, the seven expressive local regions are constructed based on these key points. Note that the interiors of mouth and eyes are currently not included in the seven local re- gions. The reasons are twofold: (1) the interiors of mouth and eyes are isolated from the facial skin. They can be Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) 0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006 IEEE (b) (a) . 64facial ﬁducial points and 7se- lected facial regions. treated as three separated objects. These “holes” are com- plementary areas of the facial skin area. The change of their shapes is directly reﬂected on the change of the surroundingskins which have been included in the seven expressive re-gions; (2) although tongues and eye-balls can be viewed asthe signatures of facial expressions, their appearances may not be as stable as the facial skin due to the dark hole effect existing in the current 3D imaging systems. In short, the selected seven local regions cover the most expressive areas on a human face. In each selected region, we identify the expression signature by calculating the his-togram distribution of primitive labels. Such a distributionis described as follows: r i=/bracketleftbiggni1 ni,···,nim ni,···,niM ni/bracketrightbigg (10) where nimis the number of vertices which are labeled by the label type Lm, andniis the total number of vertices in the ith local region ( ni=M/summationtext m=1nim).M=1 2 is the number of the primitive label categories. The combination of seven histogram distributions of the selected entire regions generates a unique expression de- scriptor for a speciﬁc expression. As a result, the expres- sion is described by the primitive surface feature distribu-tion (PSFD), which is expressed by E=[r 1,···,ri,···,rK] (11) where Kis the number of expressive regions ( K=7in our experiment). 4. Recognition Experiments 4.1. Database We constructed a 3D facial expression database for our experiment. The 3D range data is scanned by a 3DMD static digitizer [15], which uses a random light pattern projectionin the speckle projection ﬂash environment . The modelresolution is in the range of 20,000 polygons to 35,000 polygons, depending on the size of the face being scanned.The facial expressions with six universal emotional states, Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness and Surprise , are sampled in four different levels of intensity (e.g., from lesspronounced to more pronounced). In our experiment, we used the data captured from 60subjects with two high- intensity models for each expression. The test is based onthe six prototypic expressions. Each range facial model consists of a meshed surface model and an associated texture image. The head pose can be estimated by a triangle plane determined by the in- ner corners of two eyes and a nose tip. Given the head pose, the original scan is processed by rotating the model to the frontal view. This pre-processing results in a work- ing model , on which we manually labeled 64ﬁdicual ver- tices for the expression recognition experiments. gives a summary of the data set that we used for our exper- iments.

Recognition Results Our facial expression recognition experiments are car- ried out in a person-independent manner, which is believed to be more challenging than a person-dependent approach [17]. We randomly partitioned the 60subjects into two sub- sets: one with 54subjects for training and the other with 6subjects for test. The experimental paradigm guarantees that any subject used for testing does not appear in the train-ing set because the random partition is based on the subjectsrather than the individual expression. Four popular clas- siﬁers: Quadratic Discriminant Classiﬁer (QDC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naive Bayesian Classiﬁer (NBC), and Support V ector Classiﬁer (SVC) with RBF ker- nel are used in the experiments. The tests are executed 20 times on each classiﬁer with different partitions to achieve a stable generalization recognition rate. The entire process guarantees that every subject is tested at least once for each classiﬁer. For each round of the test, all the classiﬁers are reset and re-trained from the initial state.

Comparison Study In this section, we compare the proposed 3D primitive feature distribution method (3D-PSFD) with two 2D ap- pearance feature based methods. One is the well-knownGabor-wavelet (GW) approach [16] and the other is our re- cently developed Topographic Context (TC) approach [24]. (1) In the Gabor-wavelet (GW) based approach, a set of multi-scale and multi-orientation coefﬁcients are calculated to describe the appearance variations in the facial region. We applied 6×3complex Gabor-wavelet ( 6orientations and 3spatial resolutions) on 34ﬁducial points. The coefﬁcients of the real and imaginary parts can be computed as: G+(x,y;ω,θ)=ω2 σ2·e−ω2(x2+y2) 2σ2·{cos[ω(xcosθ+ysinθ)]−e−σ2 2} G−(x,y;ω,θ)=ω2 σ2·e−ω2(x2+y2) 2σ2·sin[ω(xcosθ+ysinθ)] (12)where we let σ=π. The three selected spatial scales are{π/4,π/8,π/16}and the 6orientations selected are {0,π/6,π/3,π/2,2π/3,5π/6}. The feature extracted at pixel(x,y)by a certain Gabor-wavelet kernel with parame- ters{ω,θ}is the amplitude of the real and imaginary coef- ﬁcients G=/radicalBig G2 ++G2−. Therefore in total, we extracted 18×34 = 612 wavelet features for each image. (2) In our existing work, we developed a Topographic Context (TC) based approach for facial expression recog- nition based on 2D static images. The TC expression fea- tures are the topographic primal sketch features inherent inthe2D facial images. We use such appearance features to describe the distinct facial expressions. Similar to our 3D based approach, we used the feature statistics to representthe2D facial expressions. It has proved to be robust to fa- cial landmark detection as a result of its intrinsic statisticsproperty (see details in [24]). The comparison study with the above two methods is conducted under various head pose conditions, including two cases: frontal view and non-frontal views. 5.1. Case 1: Frontal View Our frontal-view images are generated from the texture- mapped working models. All these images are normalized to256×256 pixels. Several examples are shown in the top row of . There are 60subjects with a total of 720 frontal-view facial images used for the test. The experi- ments are executed in a person-independent manner similar to the strategy used in Section 4.2. reports the correct recognition rates using these two methods. We found the Gabor-wavelet approach per- forms poorly when using the SVC classiﬁer, which is not comparable to the results from the other three classiﬁers.

Comparing to the performance shown in , the 3D-PSFD method is superior to the 2D appearance feature based methods when classifying the six prototypic facial ex- pressions. 5.2. Case 2: Non-frontal View In this section, we compare the performance of our 3D geometric based approach (PSFD) with the 2D appearance Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) 0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006 IEEE feature based approaches under different head pose condi- tions. We obtained the head pose information from the orig- inal face scans by estimating the triangle face-plane formed by the inner corners of two eyes and the tip of nose. Know- ing the 3D head pose, we are able to rotate the 3D model to a frontal view position or arbitrary pose positions without los- ing any geometric feature information. However, if viewedin the 2D projection plane, the appearance of 2D facial im- ages varies dramatically when the head pose is arbitrarilychanged. The difﬁculty to recover the missing appearanceinformation from 2D images makes 2D based facial expres- sion recognition sensitive to head pose variations. Using our face range models, we have generated facial expression images under different views, corresponding todifferent head poses. This is done by rotating the models to a certain degree and generating the face images in that view by texture-mapping. We generated the face images underviews of ±10 ◦,±20◦,±30◦, and±40◦for each orienta- tion (pitch and yaw rotation), resulting in 720 images for each view. shows the examples of different facial appearances under different views. . Facial expression images with dif- ferent head rotation. Top row is yaw rotation and bottom row is pitch rotation. From left to right, the rotation angle is −40◦,−30◦,−20◦, 20◦,30◦and40◦. We choose to use the LDA classiﬁer to evaluate the expression recognition performance under different head poses because in most cases LDA outputs the best recog- nition result. For all three algorithms (PSFD, GW, and TC), the LDA classiﬁer is trained using the front view face data. The recognition results with respect to different poses (e.g., pitch and yaw rotations) are shown in . From the ﬁgure, we can see that the average recognition rates of the 2D appearance feature based methods degrade con- siderably as head rotation increases, especially the Gabor-wavelet method. The extraction of Gabor-wavelet coefﬁ- cients is based on the selected ﬁducial points. The posechange alters the distribution of these ﬁducial points, and re- sults in signiﬁcant distortion of Gabor-wavelet features. On the contrary, the 3D-PSFD based approach makes the 3D primitive feature distribution invariant to the pose variations because the 3D geometric features are view-independent. .

Concluding Remarks In this paper, we investigated the issue of 3D facial ex- pression representation and recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to recognize facial ex- pressions using range data in a complete 3D space. We have proposed to extract and label the primitive 3D surface features, and derive their statistical distributions to repre- sent the distinct prototypic facial expressions. We used the primitive surface feature distribution (PSFD) as the signa- ture to distinguish facial expressions, and conducted expres-sion recognition experiments using the person-independentstrategy. Compared to the existing 2D static image based approaches (e.g., GW and TC methods), our 3D range data based approach shows superior performance as a result ofthe lighting and orientation invariance of 3D geometric fea- tures. The experiments show encouraging results in recog-nizing six prototypic facial expressions under various head- pose conditions. There are some limitations in the current work: (1)Our current data set contains only static expression models. A database including dynamic 3D facial expres- sion sequences is needed in order to study the subtle skin movement associated with facial expressions in 3D space. With the emergence of dynamic 3D imaging systems [25], it is possible to investigate the feasibility of tracking action units in 3D space to further enhance the current FACS based facial expression recognition technique. Because the dis- criminability of 3D facial expressions is dependent on the resolution of the 3D mesh, higher resolution models are re- quired in order to improve the recognition performance. (2) The current work involves the pre-processing of range data which requires manual selection of the surfaceﬁducial points. In order to realize an automatic system for3D facial expression analysis, algorithms for automatic de-tection of 3D surface features must be developed. The exist- ing approaches (e.g., free-form based [25], etc.) are promis- Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’06) 0-7695-2597-0/06 $20.00 © 2006 IEEE ing for this purpose. The above issues give rise to our future research direc- tions in order to improve facial expression analysis in the 3D space. In addition, we will investigate integrating 3D geometric shape and 2D texture information to improve our current approach. 7.

The3Dfacial geometry contains ample information about human facial expressions. Such information isinvariant to pose andlighting conditions, which haveimposed serious hurdles onmany2Dfacial analysis problems including the facial expression recognition problem [68].Itisthus ad- vantageous toexploit theavailable 3Dfacial geometry in- \u0003This workwassupported inpartbytheU.S. Government VACEPro- gram.formation totackle thevarious problems offacial analy- sis. While the3Dfacial geometry hasbeen relati velyex- tensivelyexplored andutilized inthestudy offacerecog- nition [9,10]thanks tothefast-de veloping andincreasingly mature 3Dscanning products and3Dfacereconstruction techniques, itishoweverfarlessused forfacial expression recognition. The most obvious reason forthisembarrass- ingsituation isclearly thatthere haslong been alack ofa publicly available 3Dfacial expression database toserveas acommon platform fortheresearchers inthisarea. With- outsuch adatabase, neither cantheresearchers start with problem investigation norcantheyendincomparing their results. Nowthegood newsis,Yinet.al.atBinghamton University haverecently constructed a3Dfacial expression database forfacial beha vior research andmade itpublicly available [1]. This isde\u0002nitely the\u0002rstattempt tomakea publicly available 3Dfacial expression database forthere- search community .Itisbelie vedthatthisdatabase willun- doubtedly haveagreat impact onthefacial beha viorrelated research inthenextafewyears. Wanget.al.[2]conducted the\u0002rst workof3Dfacial expression recognition ontheBU-3DFE database. They reported thatthehighest average recognition ratetheyob- tained onthisdatabase was83.6% byusing elaborately ex- tracted primiti vefacial surfacefeatures andanLDAclas- si\u0002er .Theyalso reported that thefacial expressions of happiness andsurprise were well identi\u0002ed with accuracies of95% and90.8%, respecti vely.Theycompared their re- sults with theresults obtained bytwo2Dappearance feature based methods, namely theGabor -wavelet(GW) approach andtheTopographic Conte xt(TC) approach. Inboth cases, theyshowedthattheir results outperformed those forthe2D methods. This ishighly expectable because 3Dfacial geom- etrycontains richinformation about facial expressions and ismore robustthan 2Dappearances.

Ourmethod isbased onproperties ofthelineseg- ments connecting certain 3Dfacial feature points. Thenor- malized distances andslopes ofthese linesegments com- prise asetof96distinguishing features forrecognizing six universal facial expressions, namely anger ,disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, andsurprise. Using amulti-class sup- portvector machine (SVM) classi\u0002er ,weachie vean87.1% average recognition rate. The highest average recognition rateobtained is99.2% fortherecognition ofsurprise. 2.Database description TheBU-3DFE database wasrecently developed byYin et.al.atBinghamton University .Itwasdesigned tosample 3Dfacial beha viors with different prototypical emotional states atvarious levelsofintensities. Inthedatabase, there areatotal of100subjects, among which 56arefemale and 44aremale. These subjects arewell distrib uted across dif- ferent ethnic orracial ancestries, including White, Black, East-Asian, Middle-East Asian, Hispanic Latino, andoth- ers. While being recorded, each subject wasaskedtoper- form theneutral facial expression aswell assixuniversalfacial expressions, namely anger (AN), disgust (DI), fear (FE), happiness (HA), sadness (SA), and surprise (SU). Each facial expression hasfour different levelsofintensi- ties(low,middle, high, highest), except thattheneutral fa- cialexpression hasonly oneintensity level.Thus, there are 253Dfacial expression models foreach subject, resulting in2500 3Dfacial expression models inthedatabase. Associated with each 3Dfacial expression model area raw3Dfacemesh model, acropped 3Dfacemesh model, apairoftexture images with two-angle views(about +45o and-45oawayfrom thefacefrontal normal), afrontal-vie w texture image, asetof83facial feature points, andafa- cialpose vector .These data giveacomplete 3Ddescription ofafaceunder aspeci\u0002c facial expression. Adetailed de- scription oftheBU-3DFE database canbefound in[1].In thispaper ,webase ourmethod solely onthe83facial fea- turepoints mark edonthecropped 3Dfacemesh model, as shownin.Wehereafter refer toacropped 3Dface mesh model asa3Dfacial expression model. Some exam- ples ofthe3Dfacial expression models intheBU-3DFE database areillustrated in. .The83facial feature points. 3.Featur eextraction Inthispaper ,wecarefully devise asetoffeatures based onproperties ofthelinesegments connecting certain facial feature points onthe3Dfacial expression models. Accord- ingtoEkman' sfacial action coding system (FACS)[11,12], thesixuniversal facial expressions canbeencoded byac- tion units, which describe themovements ofparticular fa- cialfeature points. Similarly ,intheMPEG-4 standard [13], thesixfacial expressions arede\u0002ned byfacial animation parameters (FAPs), which specify precisely howmuch the facial feature points havetobemoved.Inlight ofthis, we belie vethatcertain properties ofthelinesegments connect- ingfacial feature points offerasparse, compact, anduseful representation ofthe3Dfacial geometry . Wetherefore extract asetof96features, which consist ofthenormalized distances andslopes ofthelinesegments connecting asubset ofthe83facial feature points. These features arebelie vedtoplay animportant roleindetermin- ingthevarious facial expressions. The features arepicto- rially showninandtheir textual descriptions are givenin. Since thefaces ofdifferent people havedifferent sizes and proportions, inorder tomakethefeatures person- independent, wenormalize thedistance features byfa- cialanimation parameter units (FAPUs), asguided bythe MPEG-4 standard. InMPEG-4, theFAPUs servetoscale theFAPs inorder thatasingle setofFAPs canbeused with arbitrary facemodels. TheFAPUs arede\u0002ned asfractions ofdistances between certain feature points onafacemodel initsneutral state andallowtointerpret theFAPs onar- bitrary facemodels inaconsistent way.The \u0002veFAPUs areshownin.The distance features aredivided bythecorresponding FAPUs, givenastheunitin. Inaddition, theslope features (each ofwhich being a3- dimensional vector) aredivided bytheir respecti venorms, resulting inunitvectors. 11 13 1214 23246 41 2 7 8 15169101920212218 173 5 2825 26 2930 3940 46 4527 3132333435363837 4142 4344 4748 (a) (b) .(a)Thedistance features.

The3Dfacial geometry contains ample information about human facial expressions. Such information isinvariant to pose andlighting conditions, which haveimposed serious hurdles onmany2Dfacial analysis problems including the facial expression recognition problem [68].Itisthus ad- vantageous toexploit theavailable 3Dfacial geometry in- \u0003This workwassupported inpartbytheU.S. Government VACEPro- gram.formation totackle thevarious problems offacial analy- sis. While the3Dfacial geometry hasbeen relati velyex- tensivelyexplored andutilized inthestudy offacerecog- nition [9,10]thanks tothefast-de veloping andincreasingly mature 3Dscanning products and3Dfacereconstruction techniques, itishoweverfarlessused forfacial expression recognition. The most obvious reason forthisembarrass- ingsituation isclearly thatthere haslong been alack ofa publicly available 3Dfacial expression database toserveas acommon platform fortheresearchers inthisarea. With- outsuch adatabase, neither cantheresearchers start with problem investigation norcantheyendincomparing their results. Nowthegood newsis,Yinet.al.atBinghamton University haverecently constructed a3Dfacial expression database forfacial beha vior research andmade itpublicly available [1]. This isde\u0002nitely the\u0002rstattempt tomakea publicly available 3Dfacial expression database forthere- search community .Itisbelie vedthatthisdatabase willun- doubtedly haveagreat impact onthefacial beha viorrelated research inthenextafewyears. Wanget.al.[2]conducted the\u0002rst workof3Dfacial expression recognition ontheBU-3DFE database. They reported thatthehighest average recognition ratetheyob- tained onthisdatabase was83.6% byusing elaborately ex- tracted primiti vefacial surfacefeatures andanLDAclas- si\u0002er .Theyalso reported that thefacial expressions of happiness andsurprise were well identi\u0002ed with accuracies of95% and90.8%, respecti vely.Theycompared their re- sults with theresults obtained bytwo2Dappearance feature based methods, namely theGabor -wavelet(GW) approach andtheTopographic Conte xt(TC) approach. Inboth cases, theyshowedthattheir results outperformed those forthe2D methods. This ishighly expectable because 3Dfacial geom- etrycontains richinformation about facial expressions and ismore robustthan 2Dappearances. Inthispaper ,wefurther perform person andgender in- 978-1-4244-215 4-1/08/$25.00c 2008 IEEE .Some examples inBU-3DFE database. dependent facial expression recognition ontheBU-3DFE database. Ourmethod isbased onproperties ofthelineseg- ments connecting certain 3Dfacial feature points. Thenor- malized distances andslopes ofthese linesegments com- prise asetof96distinguishing features forrecognizing six universal facial expressions, namely anger ,disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, andsurprise. Using amulti-class sup- portvector machine (SVM) classi\u0002er ,weachie vean87.1% average recognition rate. The highest average recognition rateobtained is99.2% fortherecognition ofsurprise. 2.Database description TheBU-3DFE database wasrecently developed byYin et.al.atBinghamton University .Itwasdesigned tosample 3Dfacial beha viors with different prototypical emotional states atvarious levelsofintensities. Inthedatabase, there areatotal of100subjects, among which 56arefemale and 44aremale. These subjects arewell distrib uted across dif- ferent ethnic orracial ancestries, including White, Black, East-Asian, Middle-East Asian, Hispanic Latino, andoth- ers. While being recorded, each subject wasaskedtoper- form theneutral facial expression aswell assixuniversalfacial expressions, namely anger (AN), disgust (DI), fear (FE), happiness (HA), sadness (SA), and surprise (SU). Each facial expression hasfour different levelsofintensi- ties(low,middle, high, highest), except thattheneutral fa- cialexpression hasonly oneintensity level.Thus, there are 253Dfacial expression models foreach subject, resulting in2500 3Dfacial expression models inthedatabase.

Accord- ingtoEkman' sfacial action coding system (FACS)[11,12], thesixuniversal facial expressions canbeencoded byac- tion units, which describe themovements ofparticular fa- cialfeature points. Similarly ,intheMPEG-4 standard [13], thesixfacial expressions arede\u0002ned byfacial animation parameters (FAPs), which specify precisely howmuch the facial feature points havetobemoved.Inlight ofthis, we belie vethatcertain properties ofthelinesegments connect- ingfacial feature points offerasparse, compact, anduseful representation ofthe3Dfacial geometry . Wetherefore extract asetof96features, which consist ofthenormalized distances andslopes ofthelinesegments connecting asubset ofthe83facial feature points. These features arebelie vedtoplay animportant roleindetermin- ingthevarious facial expressions. The features arepicto- rially showninandtheir textual descriptions are givenin. Since thefaces ofdifferent people havedifferent sizes and proportions, inorder tomakethefeatures person- independent, wenormalize thedistance features byfa- cialanimation parameter units (FAPUs), asguided bythe MPEG-4 standard. InMPEG-4, theFAPUs servetoscale theFAPs inorder thatasingle setofFAPs canbeused with arbitrary facemodels. TheFAPUs arede\u0002ned asfractions ofdistances between certain feature points onafacemodel initsneutral state andallowtointerpret theFAPs onar- bitrary facemodels inaconsistent way.The \u0002veFAPUs areshownin.The distance features aredivided bythecorresponding FAPUs, givenastheunitin.

Two popular methods utilized mostly in the literature for the automatic FER systems are based on geometry and appearance. Even though there is lots of research using static images, the research is still going on for the development of new methods which would be quiet easy in computation and would have less memory usage as compared to previous methods. This paper presents a quick survey of facial expression recognition. A comparative study is also carried out using various feature extraction techniques on JAFFE dataset. * Previous article in issue * Next article in issue ## Keywords Facial Expression Recognition(FER) LBP LDP LGC HOG ; View PDF Special issue articlesRecommended articles</td>\n",

The3Dfacial geometry contains ample information about human facial expressions. Such information isinvariant to pose andlighting conditions, which haveimposed serious hurdles onmany2Dfacial analysis problems including the facial expression recognition problem [68].Itisthus ad- vantageous toexploit theavailable 3Dfacial geometry in- \u0003This workwassupported inpartbytheU.S. Government VACEPro- gram.formation totackle thevarious problems offacial analy- sis. While the3Dfacial geometry hasbeen relati velyex- tensivelyexplored andutilized inthestudy offacerecog- nition [9,10]thanks tothefast-de veloping andincreasingly mature 3Dscanning products and3Dfacereconstruction techniques, itishoweverfarlessused forfacial expression recognition. The most obvious reason forthisembarrass- ingsituation isclearly thatthere haslong been alack ofa publicly available 3Dfacial expression database toserveas acommon platform fortheresearchers inthisarea. With- outsuch adatabase, neither cantheresearchers start with problem investigation norcantheyendincomparing their results. Nowthegood newsis,Yinet.al.atBinghamton University haverecently constructed a3Dfacial expression database forfacial beha vior research andmade itpublicly available [1]. This isde\u0002nitely the\u0002rstattempt tomakea publicly available 3Dfacial expression database forthere- search community .Itisbelie vedthatthisdatabase willun- doubtedly haveagreat impact onthefacial beha viorrelated research inthenextafewyears. Wanget.al.[2]conducted the\u0002rst workof3Dfacial expression recognition ontheBU-3DFE database. They reported thatthehighest average recognition ratetheyob- tained onthisdatabase was83.6% byusing elaborately ex- tracted primiti vefacial surfacefeatures andanLDAclas- si\u0002er .Theyalso reported that thefacial expressions of happiness andsurprise were well identi\u0002ed with accuracies of95% and90.8%, respecti vely.Theycompared their re- sults with theresults obtained bytwo2Dappearance feature based methods, namely theGabor -wavelet(GW) approach andtheTopographic Conte xt(TC) approach. Inboth cases, theyshowedthattheir results outperformed those forthe2D methods. This ishighly expectable because 3Dfacial geom- etrycontains richinformation about facial expressions and ismore robustthan 2Dappearances.

Ourmethod isbased onproperties ofthelineseg- ments connecting certain 3Dfacial feature points. Thenor- malized distances andslopes ofthese linesegments com- prise asetof96distinguishing features forrecognizing six universal facial expressions, namely anger ,disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, andsurprise.

The highest average recognition rateobtained is99.2% fortherecognition ofsurprise. 2.Database description TheBU-3DFE database wasrecently developed byYin et.al.atBinghamton University .Itwasdesigned tosample 3Dfacial beha viors with different prototypical emotional states atvarious levelsofintensities. Inthedatabase, there areatotal of100subjects, among which 56arefemale and 44aremale. These subjects arewell distrib uted across dif- ferent ethnic orracial ancestries, including White, Black, East-Asian, Middle-East Asian, Hispanic Latino, andoth- ers. While being recorded, each subject wasaskedtoper- form theneutral facial expression aswell assixuniversalfacial expressions, namely anger (AN), disgust (DI), fear (FE), happiness (HA), sadness (SA), and surprise (SU). Each facial expression hasfour different levelsofintensi- ties(low,middle, high, highest), except thattheneutral fa- cialexpression hasonly oneintensity level.Thus, there are 253Dfacial expression models foreach subject, resulting in2500 3Dfacial expression models inthedatabase. Associated with each 3Dfacial expression model area raw3Dfacemesh model, acropped 3Dfacemesh model, apairoftexture images with two-angle views(about +45o and-45oawayfrom thefacefrontal normal), afrontal-vie w texture image, asetof83facial feature points, andafa- cialpose vector .These data giveacomplete 3Ddescription ofafaceunder aspeci\u0002c facial expression.

Accord- ingtoEkman' sfacial action coding system (FACS)[11,12], thesixuniversal facial expressions canbeencoded byac- tion units, which describe themovements ofparticular fa- cialfeature points. Similarly ,intheMPEG-4 standard [13], thesixfacial expressions arede\u0002ned byfacial animation parameters (FAPs), which specify precisely howmuch the facial feature points havetobemoved.Inlight ofthis, we belie vethatcertain properties ofthelinesegments connect- ingfacial feature points offerasparse, compact, anduseful representation ofthe3Dfacial geometry . Wetherefore extract asetof96features, which consist ofthenormalized distances andslopes ofthelinesegments connecting asubset ofthe83facial feature points. These features arebelie vedtoplay animportant roleindetermin- ingthevarious facial expressions. The features arepicto- rially showninandtheir textual descriptions are givenin. Since thefaces ofdifferent people havedifferent sizes and proportions, inorder tomakethefeatures person- independent, wenormalize thedistance features byfa- cialanimation parameter units (FAPUs), asguided bythe MPEG-4 standard. InMPEG-4, theFAPUs servetoscale theFAPs inorder thatasingle setofFAPs canbeused with arbitrary facemodels. TheFAPUs arede\u0002ned asfractions ofdistances between certain feature points onafacemodel initsneutral state andallowtointerpret theFAPs onar- bitrary facemodels inaconsistent way.The \u0002veFAPUs areshownin.The distance features aredivided bythecorresponding FAPUs, givenastheunitin. Inaddition, theslope features (each ofwhich being a3- dimensional vector) aredivided bytheir respecti venorms, resulting inunitvectors. 11 13 1214 23246 41 2 7 8 15169101920212218 173 5 2825 26 2930 3940 46 4527 3132333435363837 4142 4344 4748 (a) (b) .(a)Thedistance features.

Two popular methods utilized mostly in the literature for the automatic FER systems are based on geometry and appearance. Even though there is lots of research using static images, the research is still going on for the development of new methods which would be quiet easy in computation and would have less memory usage as compared to previous methods. This paper presents a quick survey of facial expression recognition. A comparative study is also carried out using various feature extraction techniques on JAFFE dataset. * Previous article in issue * Next article in issue ## Keywords Facial Expression Recognition(FER) LBP LDP LGC HOG ; View PDF Special issue articlesRecommended articles   \n",

Huang University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801 fhaotang2,huangg@ifp.uiuc.edu Abstract In this paper, the problem of person-independent fa- cial expression recognition from 3D facial shapes is inves- tigated. We propose a novel automatic feature selection method based on maximizing the average relative entropy of marginalized class-conditional feature distributions and apply it to a complete pool of candidate features composed of normalized Euclidean distances between 83 facial fea- ture points in the 3D space. Using a regularized multi-class AdaBoost classi\u0002cation algorithm, we achieve a 95.1% av- erage recognition rate for six universal facial expressions on the publicly available 3D facial expression database BU- 3DFE [1], with a highest average recognition rate of 99.2% for the recognition of surprise. We compare these results with the results based on a set of manually devised features and demonstrate that the auto features yield better results than the manual features. Our results outperform the re- sults presented in the previous work [2] and [3], namely average recognition rates of 83.6% and 91.3% on the same database, respectively. 1. Introduction 3D facial shapes, which are de\u0002ned by the 3D geometry of the faces of human beings, contain important information about human's facial expressions. Such information is in- variant to pose and lighting conditions, which have imposed serious hurdles on many 2D facial analysis tasks such as 2D facial expression recognition. In light of this, the explo- ration and exploitation of 3D facial geometric information in tackling various facial analysis problems have emerged in the research community. Thanks to the fast-developing and increasingly mature 3D range scanning products and computer vision based techniques for 3D face reconstruc- tion from one or more 2D images, the 3D facial geometric information has been relatively extensively utilized in the study of face recognition [4, 5]. However, unlike in the case of face recognition, far fewer work has been done on facial expression recognition which takes advantage of the 3D facial geometric information. The most obvious reasonfor this embarrassing situation is that there has long been a lack of a publicly available 3D facial expression database to serve as a common platform for the researchers in the \u0002eld. Without such a database, neither can the researchers start with problem investigation nor can they end in comparing their results. Now the good news is, Yin et. al. at Bing- hamton University have recently constructed a 3D facial expression database for facial behavior research and made it publicly available [1]. This is de\u0002nitely the \u0002rst attempt to make a publicly available 3D facial expression database for the research community. It is believed that the existence of this database will have a great impact on the facial behavior relevant research in the next a few years to come. Wang et. al. [2] performed the very \u0002rst work of 3D facial expression recognition on the BU-3DFE database. They reported that the highest average recognition rate they had obtained on this database was 83.6% by using elaborately extracted primitive facial surface features and an LDA classi\u0002er. They also reported that the facial expressions of happiness and surprise were well identi\u0002ed with accuracies of 95% and 90.8%, respectively. They compared their results with the results obtained by two 2D appearance feature based methods, namely the well- known Gabor-wavelet (GW) approach and the Topographic Context (TC) approach. In both cases, they showed that their results outperformed those for the 2D methods. They demonstrated that by incorporating 3D facial geometric information the facial expression recognition problem can be better solved. This is highly expectable because 3D facial shapes contain rich information about facial expressions and are more robust than 2D appearances. Soyel and Demirel [3] also conducted 3D facial expres- sion recognition work on the BU-3DFE database. They applied a carefully tuned neural network architecture to \u0002ve characteristic facial feature distances that represent the eye opening, eyebrow height, mouth opening, mouth height, and lip stretching. They reported that the average recogni- tion rate of their system was 91.3% and the highest average recognition rate reached to 98.3% in the recognition of surprise. As of the writing of this paper, to the best of our knowledge, this is the only work that claims better results 978-1-4244-2340-8/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE . Some examples in the BU-3DFE database showing six universal facial expressions with four levels of intensities. than Wang et. al.'s work on the same database. In this paper, we further investigate the problem of person-independent facial expression recognition from 3D facial shapes based on the BU-3DFE database. We propose a novel automatic feature selection method based on max- imizing the average relative entropy of marginalized class- conditional feature distributions and apply it to a complete pool of candidate features composed of normalized Eu- clidean distances between 83 facial feature points in the 3D space. Using a regularized multi-class AdaBoost classi\u0002ca- tion algorithm with three different weak classi\u0002ers, namely Nearest Neighbor (NN), Naive Bayes (NB), and LDA, we achieve a 95.1% average recognition rate for six universal facial expressions, namely anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The highest average recognition rate that we obtain is 99.2% for the recognition of surprise. We compare these results with the results based on a set of man- ually devised features and demonstrate that the auto features yield better results than the manual features. In addition, we show that our results outperform the results presented in the previous work [2] and [3], namely average recognition rates of 83.6% and 91.3% on the same database, respectively. 2. Database description The BU-3DFE database was recently developed by Yin et. al. at Binghamton University. It was designed to sample 3D facial behaviors with different prototypical emotional states at various levels of intensities. There are a total of 100 subjects in the database. Among these subjects, 56 are female and 44 are male. The subjects are well dis-tributed across different ethnic or racial ancestries, includ- ing White, Black, East-Asian, Middle-East Asian, Hispanic Latino, and others. While being recorded, each subject was asked to perform the neutral facial expression as well as six universal facial expressions, namely anger (AN), dis- gust (DI), fear (FE), happiness (HA), sadness (SA), and sur- prise (SU). Each facial expression has four levels of inten- sities (low, middle, high, highest or 01-04), except that the neutral facial expression has only one intensity level (00). Thus, there are 25 3D facial expression models for each subject, resulting in 2500 3D facial expression models in the database. Associated with a 3D facial expression model are a raw 3D face mesh model, a cropped 3D face mesh model, a pair of texture images with two-angle views (about +45oand - 45oaway from the face frontal normal), a frontal-view tex- ture image, a set of 83 facial feature points, and a facial pose vector. These data give a complete 3D description of a face under a speci\u0002c facial expression. A detailed description of the BU-3DFE database can be found in [1]. In this pa- per, we only use the 83 facial feature points marked on the cropped 3D face mesh model, as shown in (a). We refer to a cropped 3D face mesh model as a 3D facial ex- pression model. Some examples of the 3D facial expression models in the BU-3DFE database are illustrated in . 3. Feature extraction In this paper, we manually devise a set of features (here- after referred to as the manual features, as compared to the automatically selected features, namely the auto features) based on the normalized Euclidean distances between the facial feature points on the 3D facial expression models. According to Ekman [6, 7], the six universal facial expres- sions are coded by combinations of action units, which are caused by the movements of particular facial feature points. Similarly, the MPEG-4 standard [8] speci\u0002es that the six universal facial expressions correspond to six unique fa- cial con\u0002gurations, which can be obtained by adjusting the weights of certain facial animation parameters (FAPs). The FAPs will change the relative position of the facial feature points, resulting in distinct collocation patterns of facial fea- ture points. In light of this, we believe that the distances be- tween certain facial feature points offer a sparse, compact, yet information-rich representation of the 3D facial shape.Such representation is invariant to translations and rotations of the 3D facial geometry. We extract a set of 24 features composed of the nor- malized distances between a subset of the 83 facial feature points. These distances are believed to play an important role in determining the various facial expressions. The 24 features are shown in (b) and their textual descrip- tions are given in . Since the faces of different people tend to have differ- ent sizes and proportions, in order to make the features person-independent, we normalize the distances by facial animation parameter units (FAPUs), as guided by theMPEG-4 standard. In MPEG-4, the FAPUs serve to scale the FAPs in order that a single set of FAPs can be used with arbitrary face models. The FAPUs are de\u0002ned as fractions of distances between certain feature points on a face model in its neutral state and allow us to interpret the FAPs on arbitrary face models in a consistent way. The \u0002ve FAPUs are shown in . The distances are then divided by the corresponding FAPUs, given as the unit in . 4. Automatic feature selection In a typical pattern classi\u0002cation system, the features are generally devised by experts from the domain of the problem. While expert-derived features are often compact and useful, to derive them requires domain knowledge and many trials and errors. An attractive scheme is that we have a large pool of candidate features, which are relatively easy to collect, and we want a computer algorithm to be able to automatically select the best features from this candidate feature pool. In order to perform automatic feature selection, one has to tell the computer algorithm in what sense a feature is considered the best. Since our goal is to classify patterns, the discrimination power comes in naturally. In general, the more discrimination power a feature possesses, the more it will contribute to the classi\u0002cation accuracy. Thus, intu- itively and naturally, we want an automatic feature selection algorithm to select from the candidate pool those features 11 13 1214 23246 41 2 7 8 15169101920212218 173 5 (a) (b) .

From a Bayesian point of view, the discrimination power of a feature vector DP(x)depends on how much discrimi- native information lies in the class-conditional distributions ofx. The more differences that the class-conditional distri- butions exhibit, the more discriminative information there is in x. A good metric that measures the differences be- tween two probability distributions is the relative entropy, or Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) [9].

Inspired by Darwin’s evolutionary basis for expressions, Ekman et al. [20] introduced their seminal study about facial expressions. They identified seven primary, universal ex- pressionswhereuniversalityrelatedtothefactthattheseexpressionsremainthesameacross differentcultures[18].

This process involves a feed forward step, where we stream the inputthroughthenetwork,whilerecordingtheconsequentactivationsinthemiddlelayers. Afterwards, one fixes the desired filter’s (or neuron) output, and sets all other elements to the neutral elements (usually 0). Then, one “back-propagates” through the network all the way to the input layer, where we would get a neutral image with only a few pixels set - those are the pixels responsible for max activation in the fixed neuron. Zeiler et al. found that while the first layers in the CNN model seemed to learn Gabor-like filters, the deeper layers were learning high level representations of the objects the network was trained to recognize.Byfindingthemaximalactivationforeachneuron,andback-propagatingthrough thedeconvolutionlayers,onecouldactuallyviewthelocationsthatcausedaspecificneuron toreact.

Its efficiency and valid measurement are challenges that automated facial image analysis seeks to address. Most publically available databases are limited to 2D static images or video of posed facial behavior. Because posed and un-posed (aka ?spontaneous?) facial expressions differ along several dimensions including complexity and timing, well-annotated video of un-posed facial behavior is needed. Moreover, because the face is a three-dimensional deformable object, 2D video may be insufficient, and therefore 3D video archives are required. We present a newly developed 3D video database of spontaneous facial expressions in a diverse group of young adults. Well-validated emotion inductions were used to elicit expressions of emotion and paralinguistic communication. Frame- level ground-truth for facial actions was obtained using the Facial Action Coding System. Facial features were tracked in both 2D and 3D domains. To the best of our knowledge, this new database is the first of its kind for the public. The work promotes the exploration of 3D spatiotemporal features in subtle facial expression, better understanding of the relation between pose and motion dynamics in facial action units, and deeper understanding of naturally occurring facial action. * Previous article in issue * Next article in issue ## Keywords 3D facial expression FACS Spontaneous expression Dynamic facial expression database ## 1\\. Introduction Research on computer-based facial expression and affect analysis has intensified since the first FG conference in 1995. The resulting advances have made the emerging field of affective computing possible. The continued development of emotion-capable systems greatly depends on access to well- annotated, representative affective corpora [13]. A number of 2D facial expression databases have become available (e.g., [1], [2], [7], [8], [16]), as well as some with 3D imaging data (e.g., [9], [14], [15], [24], [25], [45]). Although some systems have been successful, performance degrades when handling expressions with low intensity appearance, large head rotation, subtle skin movement, and/or lighting changes with varying postures. Due to the limitations of describing facial surface deformation when 3D features are evaluated in 2D space, 2D images with a handful of features may not accurately reflect the authentic facial expressions (e.g., in-depth motion of 3D head pose, 3D wrinkles and skin extrusion in the areas of the cheek, forehead, glabella, nasolabial, and crow's feet).Another problematic issue is that facial action units (AUs) can occur in more than 7000 different complex combinations [17], causing bulges and various in- and out-of-image-plane movements of permanent facial features, negative emotions from view of the left hemiface, and mouth extrusions that are difficult to detect in a 2D plane. Three-dimensional dynamic surface analysis and tracking will be important for those facial expressions for which 2D motion information is not sufficient. Because the face is a 3D object and many communicative signals involve changes in depth and head rotation, inclusion of 3D information is an important addition. Another major limitation of existing databases is that most have only posed or acted facial behavior, and thus the data are not representative of spontaneous affective expression, which may differ in timing, complexity, and intensity from posed expression [22]. No currently available dataset contains _dense_ , _dynamic_ , _3D_ facial representations of _spontaneous_ facial expression with anatomically-based (FACS) _annotation_ [36]. Currently, most approaches to automatic facial expression analysis attempt to recognize a set of prototypic emotional expressions (e.g., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) [3], [5], [13]. Many studies about emotion used ?acting? or ?emotion portrayals? in a restricted sense by recording subjects who are instructed to express single-label emotions, sometimes using scripts [6]. However, the resulting posed and exaggerated facial actions may occur only rarely in daily life [4]. Because posed and un-posed (aka ?spontaneous?) facial expressions differ along several dimensions [32], including complexity (especially with respect to segmentation), well-annotated video of un-posed facial behavior is needed. Moreover, as noted above, because the face is a three-dimensional deformable object, a 3D video archive would be especially important. Two-dimensional databases, such as RU-FACS [23] or Cohn?Kanade [2], are insufficient. The CMU Multi-PIE database [34], 3D dynamic AU database [35], Bosphorus database [9], KDEF [33], BU 3D facial expression databases [14], [15], and ICT-3DRFE database [24] begin to address the need for 3D (or multi-view) data but are limited to posed facial behavior. Recent efforts to collect, annotate, and analyze spontaneous facial expression for community use have begun [26], [27], [28]. However, all are limited to the 2D domain or thermal imaging. To address the need for well-annotated, dynamic 3D video of spontaneous facial behavior in response to meaningful and varied emotion inductions, we developed a _3D Dynamic Spontaneous_ facial expression database with _annotation_ , called the _Binghamton_ ? _Pittsburgh 4D Spontaneous Expression Database_ (_BP4D_ -_Spontaneous_), for the research community. The contributions of the work are as follows: * (1) We applied a series of well-designed tasks for authentic emotion induction. The tasks include social interviews between the previously unacquainted people (one a naïve subject and the other a professional actor/director), planned activities (e.g., games), film clip watching, a cold pressor test for pain elicitation, a social challenge to elicit anger followed by reparation, and olfactory stimulation to elicit disgust. * (2) Well-experienced, certified FACS coders annotated the videos. Frame-level ground-truth for facial actions was obtained. * (3) The effectiveness of the eliciting methods has been verified by subject self- report and FACS analysis. * (4)An alternative subjective evaluation and validation were conducted by human observer ratings. * (5) A set of meta-data, including AU codes, tracked 3D/2D features, and head poses is provided. * (6) Additionally, the quality and usefulness of the database have also been evaluated and validated through a number of applications in spontaneous facial expression recognition, 3D dynamic Action Units recognition, and a case-study for authentic pain expression analysis. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the data acquisition procedure, expression elicitation method, and data processing and organization. In Section 3, we describe the creation of meta-data, including FACS coding, 3D/2D feature tracking, and head pose estimation. The experimental method and data quality are then evaluated through the analysis of the self-report information, subjective ratings, and AU statistics in Section 4. In Section 5, we further verify the usefulness of the database through applications in 4D spontaneous facial expression recognition and AU recognition, as well as a case study on pain expression analysis. Finally, concluding remarks and future work are given in Section 6. ## 2\\. High-resolution data acquisition ### 2.1. System setup A Di3D dynamic face capturing system [12] captured and generated 3D facial expression sequences. The data include both 3D model sequences and 2D texture videos. The system consists of two stereo cameras and one texture video camera. The three cameras are placed on a tripod with two lighting lamps, one of each side of the cameras. A calibrating board and a blue board are used for calibration and background segmentation. With one master machine and three slave machines, the system captures the 3D videos at a speed of 25 fps. In addition to the 3D imaging system to capture the head-shoulder regions, we have also setup a regular video camera to capture the entire scene and audio for site monitoring and as a reference for possible audio-visual editing in the future if needed. The data is captured in the normal lighting conditions of an indoor lab environment. Fig. 1 shows an example of the imaging system at work. 1. Download: Download high-res image (109KB) 2.

Data capture Each participant was instructed to sit in front of the 3D face capturing system at about 51 inches distance from the cameras. After view adjustment and an initial preview capture, the capture procedure started by following an emotion elicitation protocol as described below. #### 2.2.1. Emotional expression elicitation We define the ?spontaneous facial expressions? as facial actions that are not deliberately posed, i.e., facial actions that occur in the course of social interaction or other social or non-social stimuli. For recording spontaneous affective behavior, a good trade-off between the acquisition of natural emotional expressions and data quality is needed. If the recording environment is too constrained, genuine emotion and social signaling become difficult to elicit. If the recording environment is unconstrained, substantial error may be introduced into the recordings. In the psychology literature, well-validated emotion techniques and guidelines have been proposed to meet this challenge [43]. To elicit target emotional expressions and conversational behavior, we used approaches adapted from other investigators plus techniques that proved promising in our pilot test. Each task was administered by an experimenter who was a professional actor/director of performing arts. The tasks include _interview_ , _video_ -_clip viewing and discussion_ , _startle probe_ , _improvisation_ , _threat_ , _cold_ _pressor_ , _insult_ , and _smell_. Each task together with its target emotion is described in . Interviews elicit a wide range of emotion and interpersonal behavior [56], [57], [60]. Film clips and games [10], [46], [61] are well-validated approaches to elicit emotion. Cold pressor is well studied to safely elicit pain expressions without the risk of tissue injury [44]. Olfactory stimuli can reliably elicit disgust [62]. These methods evoke a range of authentic emotions in a laboratory environment [11]. . Eight tasks for emotional expression elicitation. Task| Activity| Target emotion ---|---|--- 1| _Interview_ : talk to the experimenter and listen to a joke (interview).| Happiness or amusement 2| _Video clip_ : watch a video clip and discuss it with the experimenter.| Sadness 3| _Startle probe_ : sudden, unexpected burst of sound.| Surprise or startle 4| _Improvisation_ : play a game in which the subjects improvise a silly song.| Embarrassment 5| _Threat_ : anticipate and experience physical threat.| Fear or nervous 6| _Cold pressor_ : submerge a hand in ice water for as long as possible.| Physical pain 7| _Insult_ : experience harsh insults from the experimenter.| Anger or upset 8| _Smell_ : experience an unpleasant smell.| Disgust After participants gave informed consent to the procedures and permissible uses of their data, the experimenter explained the general procedure (without giving any details about the specific tasks) and began the emotion inductions. Following usage in the psychology literature, each emotion induction is referred to as a ?task?. The experimenter was a professional actor and director. Each participant experienced eight tasks, as summarized in . Those tasks were seamlessly spaced with smooth transitions between them. Immediately after each task, participants completed self-report ratings of their feelings unless otherwise noted. The protocol began with a conversation, which included joke telling, between the participant and the experimenter. The relaxed exchange and shared positive emotion were intended to build rapport and elicit expressions of amusement. After rating the first experience, the participant watched and listened to a documentary about a real emergency involving a child, followed by an interview that gave them opportunity to talk about their feelings in response to the task. Reactions of sadness were the intended responses. Next, the participant was asked to participate in several activities with the experimenter. These included startle triggered by a siren, embarrassment elicited by having to improvise a silly song, fear while playing a game that occasioned physical danger, and physical pain elicited by submerging their hand in ice water. Following this cold pressor task, the experimenter intentionally berated the participant to elicit anger followed by reparation. Finally, the participant was asked to smell an unpleasant odor to evoke strong feelings and expressions of disgust. The tasks concluded with a debriefing bythe experimenter. Each task was recorded about 1?4 min and archived as described in sub-Section 2.3. The procedures elicited a range of emotions and facial expressions that include happiness/amusement, sadness, surprise/startle, embarrassment, fear/nervous, physical pain, anger/upset, and disgust. #### 2.2.2. Participants Forty-one participants (23 women, 18 men) were recruited from the departments of psychology and computer science as well as from the school of engineering. They were 18?29 years of age; 11 were Asian, 6 were African-American, 4 were Hispanic, and 20 were Euro-American (). ### 2.3. Data processing and database organization For each task, there were three synchronized videos to be captured from two gray-scale stereo cameras and one color video camera. The stereo videos were processed by four machines (PCs) in parallel. Each pair of stereo images is processed using a passive stereo photogrammetry approach to produce its own range map. The range maps are then combined to produce a sequence of high- resolution 3D images. The geometric face model contains 30,000?50,000 vertices. The 2D texture videos are 1040 × 1392 pixels/frame.

Although tasks varied in duration, to reduce storage demands and processing time, each video consists of the segment during which the participant was most expressive (about one minute on average). This reduced the retention of frames in which little facial expression occurred. The video data are about 2.6 TB in size, and the average number of vertices for each 3D model is about 37,000. .

FACS coding Automatic detection of FACS action units is a major thrust of the current research in automated facial image analysis [22]. To provide necessary ground truth in support of these efforts, we annotated facial expressions using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) [17], [18]. For each participant, we code action units associated with emotion and paralinguistic communication. Because FACS coding is time intensive, we prioritized coding to focus on 20-second segments that were most productive of facial expression. For each of the eight tasks, FACS coders coded a 20-second segment that had the highest density of facial expression. Coders were free to code for longer than 20 s if the expression continued beyond that duration. If a video was less than 20 s, it was coded in its entirety. Descriptive statistics are reported in . . Descriptive statistics for FACS-coded videos (unit of measure is seconds). Task| Activity| _Minimum_| _Maximum_| _Mean_ ---|---|---|---|--- 1| _Interview_| 13.00| 29.71| 19.67 2| _Video clip_| 12.12| 25.00| 20.21 3| _Startle probe_| 8.56| 16.76| 12.25 4| _Improvisation_| 16.14| 24.12| 19.74 5| _Threat_| 18.53| 31.00| 20.74 6| _Cold pressor_| 8.00| 23.00| 18.95 7| _Insult_| 17.24| 25.01| 19.91 8| _Smell_| 3.60| 21.40| 11.49 Note. Unit of measure is seconds. Data are based on video from all 41 participants. For each condition, two experienced FACS-certified coders independently coded onsets and offsets of 27 action units per the 2002 edition of FACS [36] using Observer Video-Pro Software [21]. These AUs, the corresponding amount of frames, and the number of AU events (from onset to offset) for each are listed in . An event is defined as a continuous series of AU from onset to offset. The observer system makes it possible to manually code digital video in stop-frame and at variable speed and later synchronize codes according to the digital time stamp. For AU 12 and AU 14, intensity was coded as well on a 0?5 ordinal scale using custom software. . Descriptive statistics for kappa reliability, events, and frames.

Overall kappa is weighted average based on 36 double-coded videos. An event is defined as a set of contiguous frames from onset frame to offset frame. To quantify the inter-observer exact (25 fps) agreement, the same thirty-six randomly selected video segments were coded by both coders. Their judgment was quantified using coefficient kappa [37], which is the proportion of agreement above what would be expected to occur by chance. reports the kappa reliability. In summary, the expression sequences were AU-coded by two experts. For each sequence, 27 AUs were considered for coding. For each of the target AUs, we have various numbers of coded events, where an event is defined as the contiguous frames from onset to offset. ### 3.2. 3D feature tracking We defined 83 feature points around the 3D facial areas of eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows, and chin contour in the initial frame of a video sequence (see Fig. 6(a)). Extended from the active appearance model approach [30], we applied our newly developed 3D geometric surface based temporal deformable shape model [40] to track 83 points on the 3D dynamic surface directly. Our developed method involves fitting a new multi-frame constrained 3D temporal deformable shape model (3D-TDSM) to range data sequences. We consider this a temporal based deformable model as we concatenate consecutive deformable shape models into a single model driven by the appearance of facial expressions. This allows us to simultaneously fit multiple models over a sequence of time with one 3D-TDSM. To construct a temporal deformable shape model, we applied a representation of the point distribution model to describe the 3D shape, in which a parameterized model _S_ was constructed by 83 landmark points on each model frame. Such a set of feature points (shape vector) was aligned by the Procrustes analysis method [30]. Principal component analysis (PCA) was then performed on the new aligned feature vector to retain 95% of the variance ofthe model. This was done to estimate the different variations of all the training shape data from the mean shape S¯, as shown in Eq. (1). By adjusting the weight vector _w_ in the range, the instances of 3D-TDSM could be constructed. When approximating a new shape _S_ , the point distribution model was constrained by both the variations in shape and the shapes of neighbor frames. In our experiment, two neighbor frames were considered. (1)S=S¯+Vw(2)D=?i=1Nui?xi2+vi?yi2+wi?zi2where _N_ is 83. After creating the instance of 3D-TDSM, the 3D range model was fully searched to find the closest point to each landmark among the instances. Then, the weight vector _w_ can be calculated. Since the shape variation was limited by both the deformation rules and the shapes of neighbor frames, if _w_ was outside of the domain it was discarded. For the remaining acceptable candidates, the Procrustes distance, between the corresponding 3D-TDSM instance (_u_ , _v_ , _w_) and the result from fitting (_x_ , _y_ , _z_), was computed (as shown in Eq. (2)). The candidate with the minimum _D_ value was chosen as the tracking result. Fig. 5 illustrates the fitting process, and Fig. 7 (lower row) shows several sample frames of the tracked 83 feature points on a 3D model sequence. The detailed algorithm is described in [40]. 1.

The one with the minimum score (bottom right) is the best fit. ### 3.3. 2D feature tracking Two-dimensional facial expression sequences were automatically tracked using the constrained local model (CLM) approach of [38], [39]. Forty-nine landmark points were defined in the 2D face region (see Fig. 6(b)). All CLM tracking was reviewed offline for tracking errors. Coded were: 1) ?Good tracking?; 2) ?Multiple errors?; 3) ?Jawline off?; 4) ?Occlusion?; and 5) ?Face out of frame?. A confidence score of tracking performance was given for each frame. If the score is lower than the error threshold, the frame is reported as lost- track. Fig. 7 (upper row) shows several sample frames with the tracked points. 1.

Download: Download full-size image Fig. 7. CLM-tracked feature points on a 2D sequence of a male subject (upper row); a sample 3D sequence with 3D-TDSM tracked feature points of a female subject (lower row). Note that the 3D-TDSM tracks the 83 feature points purely based on 3D geometry shape while the 2D-CLM tracks 49 feature points based on 2D images only. The lost-track rates of 3D-TDSM and 2D-CLM are 0.148% and 0.194%, respectively. The tracked 3D points offer features that are not reliably available from 2D tracking in case of large pose variations. Since the two sets of tracking points were obtained independently, they can be used for mutual verification and compensation, thus allowing researchers for further study of feature alignment between 2D and 3D, and developing algorithms for 2D/3D feature detection and tracking with comparison to the baseline 2D/3D features that we provide. ### 3.4. Head pose tracking Head pose, which includes rigid head motion, is important for image registration and is itself of communicative value, (e.g., downward head pitch when coordinated with smiling communicates embarrassment.) Two sets of headpose data are provided based on 3D and 2D modalities. In 2D texture sequence, head pose was measured from the 2D videos using a cylindrical head tracker [19]. This tracker is person-independent, robust, and has concurrent validity with a person-specific 2D + 3D AAM [20] and with a magnetic motion capture device [19]. In 3D dynamic sequences, the 3D geometric features can derive the pose information directly using three points (i.e., two eye corners and one nose-base point). The head pose (pitch, yaw, and roll) was measured with respect to the frontal pose. shows the proportion of frames which differs from the frontal view. In the case of extreme head movement, which causes over 50% partial occlusion of facial regions, the pose information is not obtainable; thus, the frame is labeled as lost-track. . Proportion of frames in different pose relative to the frontal view. Empty Cell| Pitch| Yaw| Roll ---|---|---|--- &lt; 5°| 60.3%| 80.0%| 86.4% &lt; 10°| 94.7%| 97.5%| 98.0% &lt; 15°| 99.5%| 99.6%| 99.8% &lt; 20°| 99.9%| 99.8%| 99.9% &gt; 20°| 0.1%| 0.2%| 0.1% Since the head pose information has been derived from two different modalities with independent algorithms, the lost-track errors occur only when both pose tracking methods fail. As a result, the lost-track error of pose is only 0.063%. The error is reduced as compared to the individual error rates of the two tracking methods (as indicated in Section 3.3). In short, the 3D-TDSM and the 2D-CLM provide the tracking results of BP4D-Spontaneous in two modalities. The accuracy of head pose tracking is increased due to the combination of the two tracking results. ## 4\\. Evaluation and analysis In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the emotion elicitation, we analyze the data statistically based on participants' self-report, subjective ratings from naïve observers, and AU distributions from coded videos. ### 4.1. Participants' self-report &amp; analysis After each task, participants used 6-point Likert-type scales (0 to 5, none to extremely) to report their felt emotions for each task. The emotions listed were _relaxed_ , _happiness_ /_amusement_ , _disgust_ , _anger_ /_upset_ , _sadness_ , _sympathy_ , _surprise_ , _fear_ /_nervous_ , _embarrassment_ , _physical pain_ , _and startle_. As has been found previously [53], participants could and did experience more than one emotion for each task. Fig. 8 shows the highest rated emotions reported for each task. Similarly, compares the most highly-rated emotion and the target emotion for each task. Except for task 7, the target emotion for each task (see ) was the one most highly rated by the majority of participants. For instance, the highest bar of task 8 shows that the majority of subjects rated the ?disgust? emotion as the main emotion for that task. The highest bar of task 6 shows the majority of subjects rated the ?pain? feeling as the main emotion. Accordingly, almost all of the other tasks show this property as well. For task 7, the most highly rated emotions could all be expected from the context (anger at the experimenter, embarrassment from not doing better). Overall, the tasks generally succeeded in evoking the target emotions. 1. Download: Download high-res image (235KB) 2. Download: Download full-size image Fig. 8. Statistics of self-report emotion distribution for task 1 to task 8 (from left to right); vertical axis is the number of votes. . Major emotions elicited from each task based on self-report.Task| Target emotion| Emotion most reported ---|---|--- 1| Happiness or amusement| Happiness/amusement 2| Sadness| Sadness 3| Startle or surprise| Startle, surprise 4| Embarrassment| Embarrassment 5| Fear or nervous| Nervous/fear 6| Physical pain| Physical pain 7| Anger or upset| Anger/upset, embarrassment 8| Disgust| Disgust To study the emotion distribution, we analyze all scales except 0 (None) of the self-report rating of each task and illustrate the emotion scale distribution in Fig. 9. The markers on each line show the intensity percentage among the votes for the corresponding emotion category. Note that one to three emotions for each task are selected for illustration. Our selection criteria are based on the results in Fig. 8; for each task, we select a given emotion for illustration if its vote count in Fig. 8 makes up over 20% (approximately 13 votes) of the total votes for the task. In general, Fig. 9 supports the findings of Fig. 8 in that the major emotions of each task illustrated in Fig. 8 have high grades (scale 3 and above) in Fig. 9. In other words, the high grades (from scale 3 to the highest scale 5) account for the majority of the votes from the 41 subjects for the target emotions of each task. 1.

Self-reported emotion distribution across 5 scales (very slightly, a little, moderately, quite a bit, extremely) in each of the eight tasks (from left to right, top to bottom, the charts correspond to the tasks 1?8 as shown in Fig. 8). Most of the tasks could elicit multiple emotions or mixed emotions. However, there is still a principal emotion for each task. For the tasks such as task 2 (Documentary for Sadness), task 3 (Burst of Sound for Surprise/Startle), task 6 (Cold Pressor for Physical Pain), and task 8 (Smell for Disgust), the majority of votes are distributed in the highest (or second highest) grades, showing that the target emotion elicitation of those tasks was successful and the intensity of the corresponding emotions is strong. For task 7 (Insult for Anger/Upset), although the intensity of ?anger/upset? is not very strong, the ?anger/upset? emotion is still a major emotion of this task. In general, the self-report information shows the target emotions were elicited effectively. ### 4.2. Subjective rating and analysis #### 4.2.1. Expression labeling from naïve observers To evaluate the results of the emotion elicitation, we conducted a subjective rating experiment by asking naïve observers to label each video with two of the eight expressions for all the tasks. Five naïve observers were recruited to participate in the rating experiment. First, the purpose of the experiment was explained to the observer. Then, the observer watched the AU coded video segments of all subjects in the database. The videos were presented randomly in order to avoid any ordering effect, and the videos were also muted to ensure that their rating was only based on the visual information. For each video segment, eight expression labels were provided to choose from. The observer was asked to choose up to two most likely expressions in the order of their confidence. To indicate the confidence level of each choice, the observer used a three-scale list which represents _high confidence_ , _moderate confidence_ , and _low confidence_.The observer was allowed to replay the video segment if needed. A timer was started when a given video segment was started, and it was stopped when the final choices for the segment were made. In this way, the expression rating and judgment time were also recorded. If the target emotion of a task was recognized by an observer correctly, which means that the corresponding target expression was included in the top two choices by the observer, we count it as a correct recognition. The results show that the correct recognition rates of five naïve observers are 61% (happiness), 77.1% (sadness), 94.6% (startle), 65.9% (embarrassment), 73.2% (fear), 66.8% (pain), 55.1% (anger), and 83.4% (disgust). #### 4.2.2. Analysis of subjective ratings The inter-rater reliability was examined using Fleiss' kappa coefficient [37]. This has been used to assess the reliability of agreement between raters when assigning categorical ratings to a number of items. In our case, five raters assigned eight expression categories to all 328 video segments. The kappa value is in the range of ? 1 to 1, corresponding to a negative range (? 1, 0) and a non-negative range (0, 1). The non-negative value between 0 and 1 can be divided into 0.2 sized steps. Therefore, a total of 6 levels can be generated. Landis and Koch interpret the six levels as _poor_ , _slight_ , _fair_ , _moderate_ , _substantial_ , and _almost perfect_ agreement, respectively [63]. shows the Fleiss' kappa value for 8 expression categories. The overall kappa indicates moderate agreement between all observers. . Kappa coefficients from multiple raters for expression categories. Expression| Kappa value ---|--- Happiness/amusement| 0.4325 Sadness| 0.6335 Startle| 0.8366 Embarrassment| 0.4128 Fear| 0.4933 Physical pain| 0.5250 Anger| 0.3724 Disgust| 0.7193 Overall| 0.5535 To further evaluate the performance, observers' confidence level and their judgment time factor are also studied. We assigned to the confidence levels _low_ , _moderate_ , and _high_ the values _0_ , _1_ , and _2_ , respectively. The judgment time factor is a value of a given judgment time divided by the length of the corresponding video segment of a task. If an observer spends more time to make a decision than the length of the video segment, the factor of the task is larger than 1. Otherwise, the factor is less than 1 if less time is used. lists the average values of confidence levels and the average values of judgment time factor. . Average value of confidence level and judgment time factor for expression categories.

The diagonal line shows the correct recognition rates. Among them, _startle_ , _disgust_ , and _sadness_ are among the three most distinguishable spontaneous expressions with the three highest recognition rates by observers. _Happiness_ is sometimes confused with _embarrassment_ as people sometimes show a soft smile in an embarrassing situation. For the improvisation task, subjects felt embarrassed, and, in the insult task, subjects could also feel embarrassed if they thought they had not performed well. It is not unusual for people to restrain their genuine negative emotions in social activities. People are likely to show a soft smile in an awkward situation to defuse tension. Thus, the smile could be misread by observers. . Confusion matrix for the relationship between target expression and observers' recognition.

However, in general, the correct classification rates for all the expressions in are still dominant when compared to the misclassification rates. The results are comparable to the results obtained with machine recognition (which will be described in Section 5.1). This shows that our elicitation method is effective when eliciting distinctive facial activities associated with different tasks. The distinctive dynamic information exhibited in spontaneous expressions benefits expression reading by human observers. ### 4.3. Action unit analysis #### 4.3.1. AU distribution in spontaneous expressions Holistic expressions of emotion can be defined in terms of one or more anatomic actions [52], [54], [55]. Following the previous work [16], [48], [49], [50], shows a mapping between AU(s) and the hypothetical emotion. shows the 27 action unit distributions across the eight tasks. The value is a percentage _P_ that is defined as follows:(3)P=NAUi/Ntwhere _N_ AUi is the number of frames that show the _i_ th coded AU of a task (i = 1, 2, ?, 27), and _N_ t is the total number of AU coded frames of the task (t = 1, 2, ?, 8). In this section, we report the extent to which holistic expressions defined using AUs corresponded to the target emotions. . Emotion description in terms of facial action units.

As we can see in, 41 subjects show genuine expressions which cover all the 27 action units. Also, the frequencies of different AU occurrence vary dramatically across both AUs and tasks. Unlike posed expressions, the facial action of spontaneous expressions appears involuntarily. In , AU 12 is related to happiness, and indeed a standard happy face contains AU 6 + 12. In , it shows that column T1 has a major occurrence of AU 6 (61.7%) and AU 12 (81.9%). However, it does not mean that AU 12 is unique to happiness. In fact, AU 12 occurred with varying frequencies in all tasks. This is consistent with the hypothesis that AU 12 (smiling) is not specific to positive emotion. While AU 12 is a defining feature of expressed enjoyment, it occurs in pain, embarrassment, and other negative emotions as well as in depression [51], [58], [59]. In , we know that _disgust_ has either AU 9 or AU 10 present, and task 8 (experience an unpleasant smell) gives the highest percentages of AU 9 (27.8%) and AU 10 (72.1%) among all tasks. AU 4 and AU 9are related to negative emotions. AU 4 shows relatively high percentages in negative emotion tasks such as T2 (43.6%), T6 (31.0%), and T8 (43.3%), while it shows low percentages in tasks for happiness (7.1%). Similar evidence can be found for AU 9. #### 4.3.2. Effectiveness of elicitation Besides participants' self-report and observers' rating report, we further study the AU distribution to verify the effectiveness of our emotion elicitation method objectively. Using the criteria listed in , we examine whether some AUs of the target emotions appear most frequently in the corresponding tasks. According to the percentage of AU sets that each task has in , the top two ranked tasks (in order from left to right) are illustrated in . The first column lists the AU criteria to be used for matching the corresponding target emotions (as the second column shows). For example, ?12, 24? means that either AU 12 or AU 24 needs to appear for the target emotion _Embarrassment_ ; and ?1 + 2 + 4, 1 + 2 + 5? means either AU 1 + 2 + 4 or AU 1 + 2 + 5 needs to appear for the target emotion _Fear/Nervous_. The third column shows the top two ranked tasks based on the corresponding AU counts from the spontaneous expressions of 41 subjects. It shows that the corresponding AUs appeared most frequently in the top two tasks. Moreover, these two top tasks always include the expected target emotion for all the cases (bold font). This verifies that our elicitation method is effective in eliciting the target emotions. As an example, in the second row, AU 4 is used as a criterion for matching the _sadness_ (task 2). As a result, AU 4 has the most frequent occurrence in task 2 based on . Therefore, the top ranked task is the _sadness_ task, which is exactly the expected target emotion. . Top two tasks based on FACS emotion descriptiona. AU criteria| Target emotion| Top two tasks indices ---|---|--- 12| Happiness/amusement| Embarrassment, **happiness** /**amusement** 4| Sadness| **Sadness** , disgust 5| Surprise/startle| **Startle** , sadness 12, 24| Embarrassment| **Embarrassment** , happiness/amusement 1 + 2 + 4, 1 + 2 + 5| Fear/nervous| **Fear** /**nervous** , startle 4 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 10| Physical pain| Disgust, **physical pain** 23| Anger/upset| Physical pain, **anger** /**upset** 9 + 10| Disgust| **Disgust** , physical pain a In the third column, the corresponding target emotion is in bold font. Therefore, we can see that the AU distribution of the BP4D-Spontaneous database verifies the distinctiveness of the spontaneous expressions. Similar to the results from the self-reported emotions, the findings for holistic expressions suggest that the tasks were effective in eliciting the target emotions. ## 5\\. Validation &amp; application in facial expression analysis ### 5.1. 4D spontaneous facial expression recognition To validate the data for spontaneous facial expression recognition, we apply an existing 3D dynamic facial expression descriptor [42] for expression classification. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used to learn the temporal dynamics and spatial relationships of facial regions. To do so, a generic model is adapted to each range model of a 3D model sequence. The adaptation is controlled by a set of 83 key points based on the radial basis function (RBF). After adaptation, the correspondence of the points across the 3D range model sequence is established. We apply a surface labeling approach [42] to assigneach vertex one of eight primitive shape types. Thus, each range model in the sequence is represented by a ?label map?. We use Linear Discriminative Analysis (LDA) to transform the label map to an optimal compact space to better separate different expressions. Given the optimized features, an HMM is trained for each expression. Note that the HMM is applied to the optimal features of the label map rather than the trajectories of 83 landmarks. In recognition, the temporal/spatial dynamics of a test video is analyzed by the trained HMMs. As a result, the probability scores of the test video to each HMM are evaluated by the Bayesian decision rule to determine the expression type of the test sequence. We conducted a person-independent experiment on 41 subjects. Following a 10-fold cross-validation procedure, we used 39 subjects for training and 2 subjects for testing, and achieved an average correct recognition rate of 73.7% for distinguishing eight spontaneous emotional expressions. In order to make a comparison to the existing work [15], [42], where _six prototypic posed_ 3D dynamic facial expressions were used for recognition, we have also conducted an experiment for _six prototypic spontaneous_ 3D dynamic expression recognition using the same 41 subjects. The results show that the correct recognition rate is 76.1%. Note that spontaneous expressions are more difficult to classify than posed expressions. When the same approach was applied to the 3D posed dynamic facial expression database BU-4DFE [15], a recognition rate for classifying six posed prototypic expressions is 83%. The performance degradation on classifying 3D spontaneous expressions is due to the complexity, mixture, and subtlety of the spontaneous expressions in the new database. To further evaluate our approach, we conducted a comparison study by implementing the 3D static model-based approach using geometric primitive features [29] and the 2D texture-based approach using Gabor-wavelet features [31] to classify eight expressions from the entire BP4D-Spontaneous database. Note that we used two approaches in the case of the static image or static model. In the first approach, we chose an apex frame of each video sequence for the experiment. In the second approach, we chose three frames (a frame between onset and apex, apex frame, and frame between apex and offset); we then applied expression classification on the three frames individually. The output confidence levels (output scores measured by the probability of Naïve Bayesian Classifier) for the three frames were fused by averaging the output scores for each expression. Among 8 expressions, we chose the highest fused score as the recognized expression. The average recognition rates for the static model and static frame based approaches were 62.4% and 63.2%, respectively. The average recognition rates for the three-models and three- frames-based approaches were 65.7% and 66.8%, respectively. The three-frame fusion approach does show improved performance; however, the results are not as good as those from the 3D dynamic model-based approach (i.e., 73.7% as shown above for distinguishing eight spontaneous expressions from the entire database). ### 5.2. Cross-database 4D facial expression classification We also performed a cross-database validation on our new 4D spontaneous database. A posed facial expression database (BU-4DFE [15]) was used for training, and the spontaneous database was used for testing. We extended the idea of a 3D surface primitive feature into 4D space and developed a new feature representation: the so-called ?Nebula? features [41]. Given each vertex on the face, a local spatiotemporal volume is built from the neighbor points across all frames in a time window (in our experiment, window size is 15 frames). Spatial neighborhood radius sizes of 3, 5, and 7millimeters were tested, and the corresponding spatial voxel dimensions were 7 × 7, 11 × 11, and 15 × 15, respectively. The neighborhood data are voxelized (with _x_ , _y_ , _t_ as the dimensions and depth _z_ as the values) and fit to a cubic polynomial:(4)fxyt=A12x2+B12y2+C12t2+Dxy+Ext+Fyt+Gx3+Hy3+It3+Jx2y+Kx2t+Lxy2+My2t+Nxt2+Pyt2+Q x+Ry+St+U=z. The principal curvature directions and values are computed from the eigenvectors/eigenvalues of the Weingarten matrix:(5)ADEDBFEFC. A label is assigned based on the principal curvature values and a threshold _T_. Although this label compactly describes the shape of the feature, it does not give us its orientation. This orientation information is vital, since it can give us an indication of whether the surface changes across time or not. For example, consider two features with cylindrical shapes. Both have the same label; however, one may be oriented along the time axis, indicating no change across time, while the other may be perpendicular to the time axis, indicating a sharp change across time. Therefore, we use the label as well as the polar angles of the direction of least curvature as the values for each feature. The face area is then divided into regions. A 3D histogram is built for each region of the face with the features in that region. The variables for that histogram are the shape label and the two polar angles for each feature. The concatenated histograms from each of the regions give us our final feature vector. The construction of a single Nebula feature is shown in Fig. 10. 1. Download: Download high-res image (123KB) 2. Download: Download full-size image Fig. 10. 4D Nebula feature construction: (a) sample voxel; (b) resulting polynomial volume; principal axes shown in red, green, and blue, in order of curvature magnitude (label = 14, cylinder); (c) _?_ (phi) angle of least curvature direction from the time axis (shown as _Z_ axis in image); (d) _?_ (theta) angle of least curvature direction in the _XY_ plane. We selected data (happiness, disgust, and neutral) from BU-4DFE for training. We then tested directly on the spontaneous data using the Nebula feature approach. Our overall average accuracy was 71%. From the experiment, we find that Happy-Onset is often mistaken for Disgust-Onset. One possible explanation is that the spontaneous smiles, since they are mostly genuine smiles, also show activity around the eyes similar to some of the Disgust expressions; the posed smiles from BU-4DFE do not always demonstrate this. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a cross-database test on 4D expression data has been performed. Spontaneous expression data is almost invariably more difficult to classify than posed expression data. As a consequence, we believe our results are encouraging. ### 5.3. Action unit recognition on spontaneous 4D data We also performed experiments in AU recognition on BP4D-Spontaneous. We selected 16 subjects and tested on 12 AUs using a support vector machine classifier. Please note that we only tested on the AUs listed in , . In the database, the AUs are marked as present or not present for each annotated frame. Several 9-frame windows were extracted around several transition points (either near the apex frame or near the offset frame) for each AU. Segments without the AU in question were also extracted. With three different states per AU (?AU Onset?, ?AU Offset?, and ?No AU?), tests were conducted on each AU individually. . Spontaneous action unit recognition accuracy results: ?All? = all blocks used; ?Best? = best blocks used.

Specifically, block configurations with 15, 24, 35, 54, 77, and 96 blocks were tested. The number of rows and columns in each block region configuration was chosen to make the individual blocks square, given the size of the facial region. In addition to using all of the blocks of an entire face for a given configuration, we also tested using the ?best? blocks for each AU. The best set of blocks is chosen based on where the AU appears on the face. The best blocks are in effect either dividing the face into top and bottom halves or taking the middle third of the face. For example, since AU 15 occurs around the mouth, the ?best? region blocks for that AU are all the blocks in the lower half of the face; that is, the blocks on the top part of the face are excluded. In cases where the division of blocks was uneven, blocks were included rather than excluded (for instance, if the face was divided into 5 rows and we needed the top half of the face, rows 1, 2, and 3 were chosen). The Nebula feature approach was again employed here. We also tested using the LBP-TOP (Local Binary Patterns from Three Orthogonal Planes) [47] approach on the re-rendered, pose-normalized texture images and the corresponding depth images. The accuracy results for all three approaches are shown in , while the AUC (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) score results are shown in . The confusion tables using the Nebula feature approach for each AU (using the parameters yielding the best accuracies) are shown in .. _P_ score of paired _T_ -test on discrimination between pain and other emotion tasks on AU 6, AU 9, and AU 10. Task| T1| T2| T3| T4| T5| T7| T8 ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- T6| 0.01| 4.50 × 10? 7| 3.52 × 10? 4| 4.15 × 10? 5| 3.08 × 10? 4| 0.03| 0.02 . Spontaneous action unit recognition: confusion tables for best accuracies with nebula 4D approach. The average recognition AUC score using the ideal Nebula approach for each AU (i.e., all or ?best? blocks) was over 0.738. This validates the usefulness of the new database as well as demonstrates the effectiveness of the test approaches. The highest average accuracy among all approaches is 63.3% from Nebula on the ?best? blocks. Thus, we achieve over 4% better accuracy on average with the Nebula approach over the most accurate LBP-TOP approach (LBP- TOP 2D on all blocks). The AUC scores follow the same pattern, with Nebula on the ?best? blocks giving us 0.736 AUC while the best LBP-TOP score (LBP-TOP 2D on all blocks) is 0.689. In , a common source of confusion is the misclassification between onsets/offsets and non-existence of an AU. This may due to the fact that spontaneous expression data is more challenging for AU recognition than that for posed expression data. Note that in , , if we compare the ?best? region results between Nebula and LBP-TOP 2D for individual AUs, the former is always better than the latter one. For the ?all? region test, this is also true except for AU 1 and AU 12. We also note that in LBP-TOP 2D the textured image has been pose-normalized. The results can be worse for pure 2D-based recognition approaches. This proves that 3D face representation surpasses the 2D image representation by isolating the facial components such as expression, head pose and skin tone in this experiment. In our case, facial expression data can be extracted efficiently for our experiments. Contrariwise, to analyze expression in 2D, researchers need to carefully deal with challenges from pose prediction and skin color normalization, etc., and the error coming with the pre-processing stage can contaminate the training procedure. In short, we believe that the new data and our test approaches show promise. Further details are described in [41]. ### 5.4. Case study ? pain analysis with BP4D-spontaneous database To further validate the usefulness of the 4D spontaneous data, we choose the spontaneous expression _physical pain_ for a case study. The goal is to evaluate spontaneous pain appearance with automated AU recognition. In this case, the contributed AUs may be different from the typical AUs for pain listed in . To find the contributed AUs, we use the paired _t_ -test on the possible subset of pain AUs (AU 4, 6, 7, 9, 10) for all tasks of the database. This test is to assess whether pain and other spontaneous expressions are different in terms of the AU quantity. For each possible AU, the percentage of frames with this AU is reported for each task per subject. Here we find that in terms of AU quantity the differences between pain and all other expressions are significant with AU 6, AU 9, and AU 10 (_p_ &lt; 0.05, shown in ). Therefore, the automated AU recognition system is built based on these three AUs. The positive data (AU appearance) set is acquired from task 6 (a total of 19,524 frames), while the negative data (No AU appearance) is from task 2 (a total of 20,837 frames) as it has the minimum _p_ value (4.50 × 10? 7). To generate the facial features, face normalization and feature registration procedures are applied through rotating the face model to a frontal view, cropping the 3D face region, and normalizing it to a standard size of a 72 × 72 matrix along with the landmark and pose information. Then, a Gabor waveletfilter with 3 spatial scales and 8 orientations is applied to generate the feature vector. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the feature dimension to 200. Three binary support vector machines (SVMs) are then trained with one label per frame using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel for three AUs separately. The output margin to the SVM hyper plane is used to generate the ROC curves. A leave-one-subject-out validation method is used for all 41 subjects in the database. Each test subject's sequence from task 2 and task 6 has been used as the negative test sequence and positive test sequence, respectively. The average AUC scores weighted by the positive sample numbers for AU 6, AU 9 and AU 10 are 0.865, 0.667, and 0.806 respectively. The pain appearance can be categorized in 8 (= 23) types, depending on the occurrence of each AU (0 or 1). If none of the three AUs appears, the face shows no pain. In Fig. 11(a?b), we illustrate the AU recognition performance, pain categories, and example frames. In each figure, sample frames are displayed on top. For AU 6, AU 9, and AU 10, each has been plotted with two curves, i.e., a green curve representing the automatic recognition result, and a dashed blue curve representing the ground truth from the binary AU coding. For each AU in a frame, it is labeled to 1 if the AU occurs, or 0 if the AU does not appear. Based on the eight kinds of combinations, different color indicates different pain appearances as shown in the bar ?pain categories?. ?Red? shows intense pain and ?Blue? shows no pain. 1.

Examples are the 1177th, 1290th, 1369th, and 1410th frames in the sequence. b: Physical pain appearance from a genuine pain sequence. Examples are the 14th, 99th, 203th, and 246th frames in the sequence. Fig. 11a shows the result of pain detection along a sequence of task 2, in which the subject was watching a documentary. The accuracy for AU 6 and AU 10 is 1, and the AUC score for AU 9 is 0.93. In such a non-pain activity, the subject did not show any pain expression according to AU 6, AU 9 and AU 10. The results match the ground-truth (dashed blue lines) very well in most of the sequence except for very few frames where a single AU 9 is falsely identified. Fig. 11b shows the pain detection results when the subject was submerging his hand in ice water (task 6). The AUC scores for AU 6 and AU 9 are 0.98 and 0.70, and the accuracy for AU 10 is 1. As an example, the second frame in Fig. 11b shows a less painful expression as compared to the others. Only AU 10 was detected for that frame. Thus, we have taken physical pain as a study case to show how the spontaneous expression data and the corresponding meta-data (AU codes, pose, and feature data) could be used for automated expression recognition. Based on this study, more applications of 3D-based pain analysis and further investigation of a complete set of pain-related AUs could be developed in the future. ## 6\\. Conclusion and future work In this paper, we reported our newly developed spontaneous 3D dynamic facial expression database (the so-called ?BP4D-Spontaneous? ? Binghamton?Pittsburgh 4D Spontaneous Facial Expression Database). Such a database can be a valuable resource to facilitate the research and development of human behavior analysis in security, HCI, psychology and biomedical applications. It is worth noting that stimulating genuine emotions with spontaneous facial expressions in a controlled environment is still a challenging issue. OurBP4D-Spontaneous data focused on facial actions that are not deliberately posed. Rather, they occur in the course of social interaction and other social or non-social stimuli. The guided format using a professional actor and director as the experimenter sought to simulate a more natural setting while guaranteeing high quality 3D/2D dynamic facial expression data. The AU annotation by expert coders provides valuable information about spontaneous facial behavior. However, the diversity of spontaneous expressions and the mixture of different expressions still pose big challenges for emotion and expression recognition. Expression analysis on 2D data suffers from head pose variation, illumination change, self-occlusion, etc. These influences can be removed or reduced by 3D representations. BP4D-Spontaneous addresses this issue by providing 3D time- varying spontaneous facial expression data. When we use ?Nebula? and LBP features to recognize AUs, we also noticed that the performance varies with different AUs. This may due to the different types of features exhibited by different AUs. For example, AU 4 and AU 9 create lines and furrows, while AU 25 reveals a new feature by showing teeth. That said, there may not be a panacea feature for recognition of all action units. In BP4D-Spontaneous, 3D/2D imaging data and the corresponding tracking points provide important information for feature distribution and discrimination. Combining the features from the 3D and 2D domains may improve the expression recognition performance. In future work, other settings and image capturing setups might be considered. Data quality could be improved by using a wider range imaging system which is more robust to different illumination conditions. The database will also be expanded to include more subjects. Moreover, our current database includes sequential geometric model data and texture data. In addition to the facial feature tracking algorithms, more powerful approaches need to be investigated in order to make the data processing and visualization fast and accurate. Automatic data annotation, registration, and efficient data representation (or compression) for micro- expression analysis will also be our next research direction. ## This material is based upon the work supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grants IIS-1051103, IIS-1051169, CNS-1205664, and CNS-1205195.

Huang University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801 fhaotang2,huangg@ifp.uiuc.edu Abstract In this paper, the problem of person-independent fa- cial expression recognition from 3D facial shapes is inves- tigated. We propose a novel automatic feature selection method based on maximizing the average relative entropy of marginalized class-conditional feature distributions and apply it to a complete pool of candidate features composed of normalized Euclidean distances between 83 facial fea- ture points in the 3D space. Using a regularized multi-class AdaBoost classi\u0002cation algorithm, we achieve a 95.1% av- erage recognition rate for six universal facial expressions on the publicly available 3D facial expression database BU- 3DFE [1], with a highest average recognition rate of 99.2% for the recognition of surprise. We compare these results with the results based on a set of manually devised features and demonstrate that the auto features yield better results than the manual features. Our results outperform the re- sults presented in the previous work [2] and [3], namely average recognition rates of 83.6% and 91.3% on the same database, respectively. 1. Introduction 3D facial shapes, which are de\u0002ned by the 3D geometry of the faces of human beings, contain important information about human's facial expressions. Such information is in- variant to pose and lighting conditions, which have imposed serious hurdles on many 2D facial analysis tasks such as 2D facial expression recognition. In light of this, the explo- ration and exploitation of 3D facial geometric information in tackling various facial analysis problems have emerged in the research community. Thanks to the fast-developing and increasingly mature 3D range scanning products and computer vision based techniques for 3D face reconstruc- tion from one or more 2D images, the 3D facial geometric information has been relatively extensively utilized in the study of face recognition [4, 5]. However, unlike in the case of face recognition, far fewer work has been done on facial expression recognition which takes advantage of the 3D facial geometric information. The most obvious reasonfor this embarrassing situation is that there has long been a lack of a publicly available 3D facial expression database to serve as a common platform for the researchers in the \u0002eld. Without such a database, neither can the researchers start with problem investigation nor can they end in comparing their results. Now the good news is, Yin et. al. at Bing- hamton University have recently constructed a 3D facial expression database for facial behavior research and made it publicly available [1]. This is de\u0002nitely the \u0002rst attempt to make a publicly available 3D facial expression database for the research community. It is believed that the existence of this database will have a great impact on the facial behavior relevant research in the next a few years to come. Wang et. al. [2] performed the very \u0002rst work of 3D facial expression recognition on the BU-3DFE database. They reported that the highest average recognition rate they had obtained on this database was 83.6% by using elaborately extracted primitive facial surface features and an LDA classi\u0002er. They also reported that the facial expressions of happiness and surprise were well identi\u0002ed with accuracies of 95% and 90.8%, respectively. They compared their results with the results obtained by two 2D appearance feature based methods, namely the well- known Gabor-wavelet (GW) approach and the Topographic Context (TC) approach. In both cases, they showed that their results outperformed those for the 2D methods. They demonstrated that by incorporating 3D facial geometric information the facial expression recognition problem can be better solved. This is highly expectable because 3D facial shapes contain rich information about facial expressions and are more robust than 2D appearances. Soyel and Demirel [3] also conducted 3D facial expres- sion recognition work on the BU-3DFE database. They applied a carefully tuned neural network architecture to \u0002ve characteristic facial feature distances that represent the eye opening, eyebrow height, mouth opening, mouth height, and lip stretching. They reported that the average recogni- tion rate of their system was 91.3% and the highest average recognition rate reached to 98.3% in the recognition of surprise. As of the writing of this paper, to the best of our knowledge, this is the only work that claims better results 978-1-4244-2340-8/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE .

In this paper, we further investigate the problem of person-independent facial expression recognition from 3D facial shapes based on the BU-3DFE database. We propose a novel automatic feature selection method based on max- imizing the average relative entropy of marginalized class- conditional feature distributions and apply it to a complete pool of candidate features composed of normalized Eu- clidean distances between 83 facial feature points in the 3D space. Using a regularized multi-class AdaBoost classi\u0002ca- tion algorithm with three different weak classi\u0002ers, namely Nearest Neighbor (NN), Naive Bayes (NB), and LDA, we achieve a 95.1% average recognition rate for six universal facial expressions, namely anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The highest average recognition rate that we obtain is 99.2% for the recognition of surprise. We compare these results with the results based on a set of man- ually devised features and demonstrate that the auto features yield better results than the manual features. In addition, we show that our results outperform the results presented in the previous work [2] and [3], namely average recognition rates of 83.6% and 91.3% on the same database, respectively. 2. Database description The BU-3DFE database was recently developed by Yin et. al. at Binghamton University. It was designed to sample 3D facial behaviors with different prototypical emotional states at various levels of intensities. There are a total of 100 subjects in the database. Among these subjects, 56 are female and 44 are male. The subjects are well dis-tributed across different ethnic or racial ancestries, includ- ing White, Black, East-Asian, Middle-East Asian, Hispanic Latino, and others. While being recorded, each subject was asked to perform the neutral facial expression as well as six universal facial expressions, namely anger (AN), dis- gust (DI), fear (FE), happiness (HA), sadness (SA), and sur- prise (SU). Each facial expression has four levels of inten- sities (low, middle, high, highest or 01-04), except that the neutral facial expression has only one intensity level (00). Thus, there are 25 3D facial expression models for each subject, resulting in 2500 3D facial expression models in the database. Associated with a 3D facial expression model are a raw 3D face mesh model, a cropped 3D face mesh model, a pair of texture images with two-angle views (about +45oand - 45oaway from the face frontal normal), a frontal-view tex- ture image, a set of 83 facial feature points, and a facial pose vector. These data give a complete 3D description of a face under a speci\u0002c facial expression. A detailed description of the BU-3DFE database can be found in [1]. In this pa- per, we only use the 83 facial feature points marked on the cropped 3D face mesh model, as shown in (a). We refer to a cropped 3D face mesh model as a 3D facial ex- pression model. Some examples of the 3D facial expression models in the BU-3DFE database are illustrated in . 3. Feature extraction In this paper, we manually devise a set of features (here- after referred to as the manual features, as compared to the automatically selected features, namely the auto features) based on the normalized Euclidean distances between the facial feature points on the 3D facial expression models. According to Ekman [6, 7], the six universal facial expres- sions are coded by combinations of action units, which are caused by the movements of particular facial feature points. Similarly, the MPEG-4 standard [8] speci\u0002es that the six universal facial expressions correspond to six unique fa- cial con\u0002gurations, which can be obtained by adjusting the weights of certain facial animation parameters (FAPs). The FAPs will change the relative position of the facial feature points, resulting in distinct collocation patterns of facial fea- ture points. In light of this, we believe that the distances be- tween certain facial feature points offer a sparse, compact, yet information-rich representation of the 3D facial shape.Such representation is invariant to translations and rotations of the 3D facial geometry. We extract a set of 24 features composed of the nor- malized distances between a subset of the 83 facial feature points. These distances are believed to play an important role in determining the various facial expressions. The 24 features are shown in (b) and their textual descrip- tions are given in . Since the faces of different people tend to have differ- ent sizes and proportions, in order to make the features person-independent, we normalize the distances by facial animation parameter units (FAPUs), as guided by theMPEG-4 standard. In MPEG-4, the FAPUs serve to scale the FAPs in order that a single set of FAPs can be used with arbitrary face models. The FAPUs are de\u0002ned as fractions of distances between certain feature points on a face model in its neutral state and allow us to interpret the FAPs on arbitrary face models in a consistent way. The \u0002ve FAPUs are shown in . The distances are then divided by the corresponding FAPUs, given as the unit in . 4. Automatic feature selection In a typical pattern classi\u0002cation system, the features are generally devised by experts from the domain of the problem. While expert-derived features are often compact and useful, to derive them requires domain knowledge and many trials and errors. An attractive scheme is that we have a large pool of candidate features, which are relatively easy to collect, and we want a computer algorithm to be able to automatically select the best features from this candidate feature pool. In order to perform automatic feature selection, one has to tell the computer algorithm in what sense a feature is considered the best. Since our goal is to classify patterns, the discrimination power comes in naturally. In general, the more discrimination power a feature possesses, the more it will contribute to the classi\u0002cation accuracy. Thus, intu- itively and naturally, we want an automatic feature selection algorithm to select from the candidate pool those features 11 13 1214 23246 41 2 7 8 15169101920212218 173 5 (a) (b) .

From a Bayesian point of view, the discrimination power of a feature vector DP(x)depends on how much discrimi- native information lies in the class-conditional distributions ofx. The more differences that the class-conditional distri- butions exhibit, the more discriminative information there is in x. A good metric that measures the differences be- tween two probability distributions is the relative entropy, or Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) [9].

Abstract Facial expressions play a significant role in human communication and behavior. Psychologists have long studied the relationship between facial expressions and emo- tions. PaulEkmanetal.[17,20],devisedtheFacialActionCodingSystem(FACS)to taxonomize human facial expressions and model their behavior. The ability to recog- nize facial expressions automatically, enables novel applications in fields like human- computer interaction, social gaming, and psychological research.

Facialexpressions(FE)playasignificantroleininter-personinteraction. Theyconveyemo- tional state, truthfulness and add context to the verbal channel. Automatic FE recognition (AFER) is an interdisciplinary domain standing at the crossing of behavioral science, psy- chology,neurology,andartificialintelligence. 1.1 FacialExpressionAnalysis Theanalysisofhumanemotionsthroughfacialexpressionsisamajorpartinpsychological research. Darwin’sworkinthelate1800’s[13]placedhumanfacialexpressionswithinan evolutionary context. Darwin suggested that facial expressions are the residual actions of more complete behavioral responses to environmental challenges. When in disgust, con- strictingthenostrilsservedtoreduceinhalationofnoxiousorharmfulsubstances. Widening oftheeyesinsurpriseincreasedthevisualfieldtobetterseeanunexpectedstimulus. Inspired by Darwin’s evolutionary basis for expressions, Ekman et al. [20] introduced their seminal study about facial expressions. They identified seven primary, universal ex- pressionswhereuniversalityrelatedtothefactthattheseexpressionsremainthesameacross differentcultures[18]. Ekmanlabeledthembytheircorrespondingemotionalstates,thatis, happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, disgust, anger, and contempt , see . Due to its simplicityandclaimforuniversality,theprimaryemotionshypothesishasbeenextensively exploitedincognitivecomputing. Inordertofurtherinvestigateemotionsandtheircorrespondingfacialexpressions, Ek- man devised the facial action coding system (FACS) [17]. FACS is an anatomically based systemfordescribingallobservablefacialmovementsforeachemotion,see.Using FACSasamethodologicalmeasuringsystem,onecandescribeanyexpressionbytheaction units(AU)oneactivatesanditsactivationintensity. Eachactionunitdescribesaclusterof facialmusclesthatacttogethertoformaspecificmovement.AccordingtoEkman,thereare 44 facial AUs, describing actions such as “open mouth”, “squint eyes” etc., and 20 other AUs were addedin a 2002 revisionof the FACS manual [21], to account for headand eye movement. 2Imagestakenfrom[42](cid:13)cJeffreyCohnBREUER,KIMMEL:ADEEPLEARNINGPERSPECTIVEONFACIALEXPRESSIONS 3: ExpressiveimagesandtheiractiveAUcoding.Thisdemonstratesthecomposition ofdescribingone’sfacialexpressionusingacollectionofFACSbaseddescriptors. 1.2 FacialExpressionRecognitionandAnalysis Theabilitytoautomaticallyrecognizefacialexpressionsandinfertheemotionalstatehasa widerangeofapplications.

Leadingchallengesin FER[15,49,50]havealsobeenledbymethodsusingCNNs[9,22,25]. Convolutional neural networks, as first proposed by LeCun in 1998 [33], employ con- ceptsofreceptivefieldsandweightsharing. Thenumberoftrainableparametersisgreatly reducedandthepropagationofinformationthroughthelayersofthenetworkcanbesimply calculatedbyconvolution.

In the effort of improving CNN performance, researchers have developed methods of exploringandunderstandingthemodelslearnedbythesemethods.

Themainideaisto visualizetheinputpixelsthatcauseacertainneuron,likeafilterfromaconvolutionallayer, to maximize its output. This process involves a feed forward step, where we stream the inputthroughthenetwork,whilerecordingtheconsequentactivationsinthemiddlelayers. Afterwards, one fixes the desired filter’s (or neuron) output, and sets all other elements to the neutral elements (usually 0). Then, one “back-propagates” through the network all the way to the input layer, where we would get a neutral image with only a few pixels set - those are the pixels responsible for max activation in the fixed neuron. Zeiler et al. found that while the first layers in the CNN model seemed to learn Gabor-like filters, the deeper layers were learning high level representations of the objects the network was trained to recognize.Byfindingthemaximalactivationforeachneuron,andback-propagatingthrough thedeconvolutionlayers,onecouldactuallyviewthelocationsthatcausedaspecificneuron toreact.

To inspect the learned models ability to generalize, we use the method of transfer learning [54] to see how these models perform on other datasets. We also measure the models’abilitytoperformonotherFERrelatedtasks, oneswhichtheywerenotexplicitly trainedfor. InordertogetasenseofthecommonpropertiesofCNN-basedstate-of-the-artmodels in FER, we employ these methods on numerous datasets. Below are brief descriptions of datasetsusedinourexperiments.

NovaEmotions NovaEmotions [40, 48], aim to represent facial expressions and emo- tional state as captured in a non-controlled environment. The data is collected in a crowd- sourcingmanner,wheresubjectswereputinfrontofagamingdevice,whichcapturedtheir response to scenes and challenges in the game itself. The game, in time, reacted to the player’s response as well. This allowed collecting spontaneous expressions from a large poolofvariations.

Images were aligned such that eyes are presented on the same horizontal line across all images in the dataset. Each frame was annotated by mul- tiple sources, both certified professionals as well as random individuals. A consensus was collectedfortheannotationoftheframes,resultinginthefinallabeling. FER 2013 The FER 2013 challenge [24] was created using Google image search API with184 emotionrelated keywords, like blissful, enraged. Keywordswere combinedwith phrases for gender, age and ethnicity in order to obtain up to 600 different search queries. Image data was collected for the first 1000 images for each query. Collected images were passed through post-processing, that involved face region cropping and image alignment. Images were then grouped into the corresponding fine-grained emotion classes, rejecting wrongfullylabeledframesandadjustingcroppedregions.

For comparison, we use the frameworks of [24, 34, 35, 43]. We analyze the networks’ ability to classify facial expression images into the 7 primary emotions or as a neutral pose. Accuracy is measured as the average score of the 10-fold crossvalidation. Ourmodelperformsatstate-of-the-artlevelwhencomparedtotheleading methodsinAFER,SeeTables1,2. 3.1 VisualizingtheCNNFilters After establishing a sound classification framework for emotions, we move to analyze the modelsthatwerelearnedbythesuggestednetwork.

Neuralnetworkmodelsoftenrequirelargetrainingsets. How- ever,insomescenariosthesizeofthetrainingsetisinsufficientforpropertraining.

We tested our models on both cross-dataset and cross-task capabilities. In most FER related tasks, AU detection is done as a leave-one-out manner. Given an input (image or video)thesystemwouldpredicttheprobabilityofaspecificAUtobeactive. Thismethod is proven to be more accurate than training against the detection of all AU activations at the same time, mostly due to the sizes of the training datasets. When testing our models against detection of a single AU, we recorded high accuracy scores with most AUs.Some action units, like AU11: nasolabial deepener, were not predicted properly in some cases whenusingthesuggestedmodel.

Ourmethodperformsatstate-of-the-artlevel(). 5 Conclusions We provided a computational justification of Ekman’s facial action units (FACS) which is thecoreofhisfacialexpressionanalysisaxiomatic/observationalframework.Westudiedthe modelslearnedbystate-of-the-artCNNs,andusedCNNvisualizationtechniquestounder- standthefeaturemapsthatareobtainedbytrainingforemotiondetectionofsevenuniversal expressions. We demonstrated a strong correlation between the features generated by an unsupervisedlearningprocessandEkman’sactionunitsusedastheatomsinhisleadingfa- cialexpressionsanalysismethods. TheFACS-basedfeatures’abilitytogeneralizewasthen verifiedoncross-dataandcross-taskaspectsthatprovidedhighaccuracyscores. Equipped with refined computationally-learned action units that align with Ekman’s theory, we ap- plied our models to the task of micro-expression detection and obtained recognition rates thatoutperformedstate-of-the-artmethods.

Its efficiency and valid measurement are challenges that automated facial image analysis seeks to address. Most publically available databases are limited to 2D static images or video of posed facial behavior. Because posed and un-posed (aka ?spontaneous?) facial expressions differ along several dimensions including complexity and timing, well-annotated video of un-posed facial behavior is needed. Moreover, because the face is a three-dimensional deformable object, 2D video may be insufficient, and therefore 3D video archives are required. We present a newly developed 3D video database of spontaneous facial expressions in a diverse group of young adults. Well-validated emotion inductions were used to elicit expressions of emotion and paralinguistic communication. Frame- level ground-truth for facial actions was obtained using the Facial Action Coding System. Facial features were tracked in both 2D and 3D domains. To the best of our knowledge, this new database is the first of its kind for the public. The work promotes the exploration of 3D spatiotemporal features in subtle facial expression, better understanding of the relation between pose and motion dynamics in facial action units, and deeper understanding of naturally occurring facial action. * Previous article in issue * Next article in issue ## Keywords 3D facial expression FACS Spontaneous expression Dynamic facial expression database ## 1\\. Introduction Research on computer-based facial expression and affect analysis has intensified since the first FG conference in 1995. The resulting advances have made the emerging field of affective computing possible. The continued development of emotion-capable systems greatly depends on access to well- annotated, representative affective corpora [13]. A number of 2D facial expression databases have become available (e.g., [1], [2], [7], [8], [16]), as well as some with 3D imaging data (e.g., [9], [14], [15], [24], [25], [45]). Although some systems have been successful, performance degrades when handling expressions with low intensity appearance, large head rotation, subtle skin movement, and/or lighting changes with varying postures. Due to the limitations of describing facial surface deformation when 3D features are evaluated in 2D space, 2D images with a handful of features may not accurately reflect the authentic facial expressions (e.g., in-depth motion of 3D head pose, 3D wrinkles and skin extrusion in the areas of the cheek, forehead, glabella, nasolabial, and crow's feet).Another problematic issue is that facial action units (AUs) can occur in more than 7000 different complex combinations [17], causing bulges and various in- and out-of-image-plane movements of permanent facial features, negative emotions from view of the left hemiface, and mouth extrusions that are difficult to detect in a 2D plane. Three-dimensional dynamic surface analysis and tracking will be important for those facial expressions for which 2D motion information is not sufficient. Because the face is a 3D object and many communicative signals involve changes in depth and head rotation, inclusion of 3D information is an important addition. Another major limitation of existing databases is that most have only posed or acted facial behavior, and thus the data are not representative of spontaneous affective expression, which may differ in timing, complexity, and intensity from posed expression [22]. No currently available dataset contains _dense_ , _dynamic_ , _3D_ facial representations of _spontaneous_ facial expression with anatomically-based (FACS) _annotation_ [36]. Currently, most approaches to automatic facial expression analysis attempt to recognize a set of prototypic emotional expressions (e.g., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) [3], [5], [13]. Many studies about emotion used ?acting? or ?emotion portrayals? in a restricted sense by recording subjects who are instructed to express single-label emotions, sometimes using scripts [6]. However, the resulting posed and exaggerated facial actions may occur only rarely in daily life [4]. Because posed and un-posed (aka ?spontaneous?) facial expressions differ along several dimensions [32], including complexity (especially with respect to segmentation), well-annotated video of un-posed facial behavior is needed. Moreover, as noted above, because the face is a three-dimensional deformable object, a 3D video archive would be especially important. Two-dimensional databases, such as RU-FACS [23] or Cohn?Kanade [2], are insufficient. The CMU Multi-PIE database [34], 3D dynamic AU database [35], Bosphorus database [9], KDEF [33], BU 3D facial expression databases [14], [15], and ICT-3DRFE database [24] begin to address the need for 3D (or multi-view) data but are limited to posed facial behavior. Recent efforts to collect, annotate, and analyze spontaneous facial expression for community use have begun [26], [27], [28]. However, all are limited to the 2D domain or thermal imaging. To address the need for well-annotated, dynamic 3D video of spontaneous facial behavior in response to meaningful and varied emotion inductions, we developed a _3D Dynamic Spontaneous_ facial expression database with _annotation_ , called the _Binghamton_ ? _Pittsburgh 4D Spontaneous Expression Database_ (_BP4D_ -_Spontaneous_), for the research community. The contributions of the work are as follows: * (1) We applied a series of well-designed tasks for authentic emotion induction. The tasks include social interviews between the previously unacquainted people (one a naïve subject and the other a professional actor/director), planned activities (e.g., games), film clip watching, a cold pressor test for pain elicitation, a social challenge to elicit anger followed by reparation, and olfactory stimulation to elicit disgust. * (2) Well-experienced, certified FACS coders annotated the videos. Frame-level ground-truth for facial actions was obtained. * (3) The effectiveness of the eliciting methods has been verified by subject self- report and FACS analysis. * (4)An alternative subjective evaluation and validation were conducted by human observer ratings. * (5) A set of meta-data, including AU codes, tracked 3D/2D features, and head poses is provided. * (6) Additionally, the quality and usefulness of the database have also been evaluated and validated through a number of applications in spontaneous facial expression recognition, 3D dynamic Action Units recognition, and a case-study for authentic pain expression analysis. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the data acquisition procedure, expression elicitation method, and data processing and organization. In Section 3, we describe the creation of meta-data, including FACS coding, 3D/2D feature tracking, and head pose estimation. The experimental method and data quality are then evaluated through the analysis of the self-report information, subjective ratings, and AU statistics in Section 4. In Section 5, we further verify the usefulness of the database through applications in 4D spontaneous facial expression recognition and AU recognition, as well as a case study on pain expression analysis. Finally, concluding remarks and future work are given in Section 6. ## 2\\. High-resolution data acquisition ### 2.1. System setup A Di3D dynamic face capturing system [12] captured and generated 3D facial expression sequences. The data include both 3D model sequences and 2D texture videos. The system consists of two stereo cameras and one texture video camera. The three cameras are placed on a tripod with two lighting lamps, one of each side of the cameras. A calibrating board and a blue board are used for calibration and background segmentation. With one master machine and three slave machines, the system captures the 3D videos at a speed of 25 fps. In addition to the 3D imaging system to capture the head-shoulder regions, we have also setup a regular video camera to capture the entire scene and audio for site monitoring and as a reference for possible audio-visual editing in the future if needed. The data is captured in the normal lighting conditions of an indoor lab environment. Fig. 1 shows an example of the imaging system at work. 1. Download: Download high-res image (109KB) 2.

Data capture Each participant was instructed to sit in front of the 3D face capturing system at about 51 inches distance from the cameras. After view adjustment and an initial preview capture, the capture procedure started by following an emotion elicitation protocol as described below. #### 2.2.1. Emotional expression elicitation We define the ?spontaneous facial expressions? as facial actions that are not deliberately posed, i.e., facial actions that occur in the course of social interaction or other social or non-social stimuli. For recording spontaneous affective behavior, a good trade-off between the acquisition of natural emotional expressions and data quality is needed. If the recording environment is too constrained, genuine emotion and social signaling become difficult to elicit. If the recording environment is unconstrained, substantial error may be introduced into the recordings. In the psychology literature, well-validated emotion techniques and guidelines have been proposed to meet this challenge [43]. To elicit target emotional expressions and conversational behavior, we used approaches adapted from other investigators plus techniques that proved promising in our pilot test. Each task was administered by an experimenter who was a professional actor/director of performing arts. The tasks include _interview_ , _video_ -_clip viewing and discussion_ , _startle probe_ , _improvisation_ , _threat_ , _cold_ _pressor_ , _insult_ , and _smell_. Each task together with its target emotion is described in . Interviews elicit a wide range of emotion and interpersonal behavior [56], [57], [60]. Film clips and games [10], [46], [61] are well-validated approaches to elicit emotion. Cold pressor is well studied to safely elicit pain expressions without the risk of tissue injury [44]. Olfactory stimuli can reliably elicit disgust [62]. These methods evoke a range of authentic emotions in a laboratory environment [11]. . Eight tasks for emotional expression elicitation. Task| Activity| Target emotion ---|---|--- 1| _Interview_ : talk to the experimenter and listen to a joke (interview).| Happiness or amusement 2| _Video clip_ : watch a video clip and discuss it with the experimenter.| Sadness 3| _Startle probe_ : sudden, unexpected burst of sound.| Surprise or startle 4| _Improvisation_ : play a game in which the subjects improvise a silly song.| Embarrassment 5| _Threat_ : anticipate and experience physical threat.| Fear or nervous 6| _Cold pressor_ : submerge a hand in ice water for as long as possible.| Physical pain 7| _Insult_ : experience harsh insults from the experimenter.| Anger or upset 8| _Smell_ : experience an unpleasant smell.| Disgust After participants gave informed consent to the procedures and permissible uses of their data, the experimenter explained the general procedure (without giving any details about the specific tasks) and began the emotion inductions. Following usage in the psychology literature, each emotion induction is referred to as a ?task?. The experimenter was a professional actor and director. Each participant experienced eight tasks, as summarized in . Those tasks were seamlessly spaced with smooth transitions between them. Immediately after each task, participants completed self-report ratings of their feelings unless otherwise noted. The protocol began with a conversation, which included joke telling, between the participant and the experimenter. The relaxed exchange and shared positive emotion were intended to build rapport and elicit expressions of amusement. After rating the first experience, the participant watched and listened to a documentary about a real emergency involving a child, followed by an interview that gave them opportunity to talk about their feelings in response to the task. Reactions of sadness were the intended responses. Next, the participant was asked to participate in several activities with the experimenter. These included startle triggered by a siren, embarrassment elicited by having to improvise a silly song, fear while playing a game that occasioned physical danger, and physical pain elicited by submerging their hand in ice water. Following this cold pressor task, the experimenter intentionally berated the participant to elicit anger followed by reparation. Finally, the participant was asked to smell an unpleasant odor to evoke strong feelings and expressions of disgust. The tasks concluded with a debriefing bythe experimenter. Each task was recorded about 1?4 min and archived as described in sub-Section 2.3. The procedures elicited a range of emotions and facial expressions that include happiness/amusement, sadness, surprise/startle, embarrassment, fear/nervous, physical pain, anger/upset, and disgust. #### 2.2.2. Participants Forty-one participants (23 women, 18 men) were recruited from the departments of psychology and computer science as well as from the school of engineering. They were 18?29 years of age; 11 were Asian, 6 were African-American, 4 were Hispanic, and 20 were Euro-American (). ### 2.3. Data processing and database organization For each task, there were three synchronized videos to be captured from two gray-scale stereo cameras and one color video camera. The stereo videos were processed by four machines (PCs) in parallel. Each pair of stereo images is processed using a passive stereo photogrammetry approach to produce its own range map. The range maps are then combined to produce a sequence of high- resolution 3D images. The geometric face model contains 30,000?50,000 vertices. The 2D texture videos are 1040 × 1392 pixels/frame.

Although tasks varied in duration, to reduce storage demands and processing time, each video consists of the segment during which the participant was most expressive (about one minute on average). This reduced the retention of frames in which little facial expression occurred. The video data are about 2.6 TB in size, and the average number of vertices for each 3D model is about 37,000. .

FACS coding Automatic detection of FACS action units is a major thrust of the current research in automated facial image analysis [22]. To provide necessary ground truth in support of these efforts, we annotated facial expressions using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) [17], [18]. For each participant, we code action units associated with emotion and paralinguistic communication. Because FACS coding is time intensive, we prioritized coding to focus on 20-second segments that were most productive of facial expression. For each of the eight tasks, FACS coders coded a 20-second segment that had the highest density of facial expression. Coders were free to code for longer than 20 s if the expression continued beyond that duration. If a video was less than 20 s, it was coded in its entirety. Descriptive statistics are reported in . . Descriptive statistics for FACS-coded videos (unit of measure is seconds). Task| Activity| _Minimum_| _Maximum_| _Mean_ ---|---|---|---|--- 1| _Interview_| 13.00| 29.71| 19.67 2| _Video clip_| 12.12| 25.00| 20.21 3| _Startle probe_| 8.56| 16.76| 12.25 4| _Improvisation_| 16.14| 24.12| 19.74 5| _Threat_| 18.53| 31.00| 20.74 6| _Cold pressor_| 8.00| 23.00| 18.95 7| _Insult_| 17.24| 25.01| 19.91 8| _Smell_| 3.60| 21.40| 11.49 Note. Unit of measure is seconds. Data are based on video from all 41 participants. For each condition, two experienced FACS-certified coders independently coded onsets and offsets of 27 action units per the 2002 edition of FACS [36] using Observer Video-Pro Software [21]. These AUs, the corresponding amount of frames, and the number of AU events (from onset to offset) for each are listed in . An event is defined as a continuous series of AU from onset to offset. The observer system makes it possible to manually code digital video in stop-frame and at variable speed and later synchronize codes according to the digital time stamp. For AU 12 and AU 14, intensity was coded as well on a 0?5 ordinal scale using custom software. . Descriptive statistics for kappa reliability, events, and frames.

Overall kappa is weighted average based on 36 double-coded videos. An event is defined as a set of contiguous frames from onset frame to offset frame. To quantify the inter-observer exact (25 fps) agreement, the same thirty-six randomly selected video segments were coded by both coders. Their judgment was quantified using coefficient kappa [37], which is the proportion of agreement above what would be expected to occur by chance. reports the kappa reliability. In summary, the expression sequences were AU-coded by two experts. For each sequence, 27 AUs were considered for coding. For each of the target AUs, we have various numbers of coded events, where an event is defined as the contiguous frames from onset to offset. ### 3.2. 3D feature tracking We defined 83 feature points around the 3D facial areas of eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows, and chin contour in the initial frame of a video sequence (see Fig. 6(a)). Extended from the active appearance model approach [30], we applied our newly developed 3D geometric surface based temporal deformable shape model [40] to track 83 points on the 3D dynamic surface directly. Our developed method involves fitting a new multi-frame constrained 3D temporal deformable shape model (3D-TDSM) to range data sequences. We consider this a temporal based deformable model as we concatenate consecutive deformable shape models into a single model driven by the appearance of facial expressions. This allows us to simultaneously fit multiple models over a sequence of time with one 3D-TDSM. To construct a temporal deformable shape model, we applied a representation of the point distribution model to describe the 3D shape, in which a parameterized model _S_ was constructed by 83 landmark points on each model frame. Such a set of feature points (shape vector) was aligned by the Procrustes analysis method [30]. Principal component analysis (PCA) was then performed on the new aligned feature vector to retain 95% of the variance ofthe model. This was done to estimate the different variations of all the training shape data from the mean shape S¯, as shown in Eq. (1). By adjusting the weight vector _w_ in the range, the instances of 3D-TDSM could be constructed. When approximating a new shape _S_ , the point distribution model was constrained by both the variations in shape and the shapes of neighbor frames. In our experiment, two neighbor frames were considered. (1)S=S¯+Vw(2)D=?i=1Nui?xi2+vi?yi2+wi?zi2where _N_ is 83. After creating the instance of 3D-TDSM, the 3D range model was fully searched to find the closest point to each landmark among the instances. Then, the weight vector _w_ can be calculated. Since the shape variation was limited by both the deformation rules and the shapes of neighbor frames, if _w_ was outside of the domain it was discarded. For the remaining acceptable candidates, the Procrustes distance, between the corresponding 3D-TDSM instance (_u_ , _v_ , _w_) and the result from fitting (_x_ , _y_ , _z_), was computed (as shown in Eq. (2)). The candidate with the minimum _D_ value was chosen as the tracking result. Fig. 5 illustrates the fitting process, and Fig. 7 (lower row) shows several sample frames of the tracked 83 feature points on a 3D model sequence. The detailed algorithm is described in [40]. 1.

The one with the minimum score (bottom right) is the best fit. ### 3.3. 2D feature tracking Two-dimensional facial expression sequences were automatically tracked using the constrained local model (CLM) approach of [38], [39]. Forty-nine landmark points were defined in the 2D face region (see Fig. 6(b)). All CLM tracking was reviewed offline for tracking errors. Coded were: 1) ?Good tracking?; 2) ?Multiple errors?; 3) ?Jawline off?; 4) ?Occlusion?; and 5) ?Face out of frame?. A confidence score of tracking performance was given for each frame. If the score is lower than the error threshold, the frame is reported as lost- track. Fig. 7 (upper row) shows several sample frames with the tracked points. 1.

CLM-tracked feature points on a 2D sequence of a male subject (upper row); a sample 3D sequence with 3D-TDSM tracked feature points of a female subject (lower row). Note that the 3D-TDSM tracks the 83 feature points purely based on 3D geometry shape while the 2D-CLM tracks 49 feature points based on 2D images only. The lost-track rates of 3D-TDSM and 2D-CLM are 0.148% and 0.194%, respectively. The tracked 3D points offer features that are not reliably available from 2D tracking in case of large pose variations. Since the two sets of tracking points were obtained independently, they can be used for mutual verification and compensation, thus allowing researchers for further study of feature alignment between 2D and 3D, and developing algorithms for 2D/3D feature detection and tracking with comparison to the baseline 2D/3D features that we provide. ### 3.4. Head pose tracking Head pose, which includes rigid head motion, is important for image registration and is itself of communicative value, (e.g., downward head pitch when coordinated with smiling communicates embarrassment.) Two sets of headpose data are provided based on 3D and 2D modalities. In 2D texture sequence, head pose was measured from the 2D videos using a cylindrical head tracker [19]. This tracker is person-independent, robust, and has concurrent validity with a person-specific 2D + 3D AAM [20] and with a magnetic motion capture device [19]. In 3D dynamic sequences, the 3D geometric features can derive the pose information directly using three points (i.e., two eye corners and one nose-base point). The head pose (pitch, yaw, and roll) was measured with respect to the frontal pose. shows the proportion of frames which differs from the frontal view. In the case of extreme head movement, which causes over 50% partial occlusion of facial regions, the pose information is not obtainable; thus, the frame is labeled as lost-track. . Proportion of frames in different pose relative to the frontal view. Empty Cell| Pitch| Yaw| Roll ---|---|---|--- < 5°| 60.3%| 80.0%| 86.4% < 10°| 94.7%| 97.5%| 98.0% < 15°| 99.5%| 99.6%| 99.8% < 20°| 99.9%| 99.8%| 99.9% > 20°| 0.1%| 0.2%| 0.1% Since the head pose information has been derived from two different modalities with independent algorithms, the lost-track errors occur only when both pose tracking methods fail. As a result, the lost-track error of pose is only 0.063%. The error is reduced as compared to the individual error rates of the two tracking methods (as indicated in Section 3.3). In short, the 3D-TDSM and the 2D-CLM provide the tracking results of BP4D-Spontaneous in two modalities. The accuracy of head pose tracking is increased due to the combination of the two tracking results. ## 4\\. Evaluation and analysis In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the emotion elicitation, we analyze the data statistically based on participants' self-report, subjective ratings from naïve observers, and AU distributions from coded videos. ### 4.1. Participants' self-report & analysis After each task, participants used 6-point Likert-type scales (0 to 5, none to extremely) to report their felt emotions for each task. The emotions listed were _relaxed_ , _happiness_ /_amusement_ , _disgust_ , _anger_ /_upset_ , _sadness_ , _sympathy_ , _surprise_ , _fear_ /_nervous_ , _embarrassment_ , _physical pain_ , _and startle_. As has been found previously [53], participants could and did experience more than one emotion for each task. Fig. 8 shows the highest rated emotions reported for each task. Similarly, compares the most highly-rated emotion and the target emotion for each task. Except for task 7, the target emotion for each task (see ) was the one most highly rated by the majority of participants. For instance, the highest bar of task 8 shows that the majority of subjects rated the ?disgust? emotion as the main emotion for that task. The highest bar of task 6 shows the majority of subjects rated the ?pain? feeling as the main emotion. Accordingly, almost all of the other tasks show this property as well. For task 7, the most highly rated emotions could all be expected from the context (anger at the experimenter, embarrassment from not doing better). Overall, the tasks generally succeeded in evoking the target emotions. 1. Download: Download high-res image (235KB) 2. Download: Download full-size image Fig. 8.

The markers on each line show the intensity percentage among the votes for the corresponding emotion category. Note that one to three emotions for each task are selected for illustration. Our selection criteria are based on the results in Fig. 8; for each task, we select a given emotion for illustration if its vote count in Fig. 8 makes up over 20% (approximately 13 votes) of the total votes for the task. In general, Fig. 9 supports the findings of Fig. 8 in that the major emotions of each task illustrated in Fig. 8 have high grades (scale 3 and above) in Fig. 9. In other words, the high grades (from scale 3 to the highest scale 5) account for the majority of the votes from the 41 subjects for the target emotions of each task. 1.

Self-reported emotion distribution across 5 scales (very slightly, a little, moderately, quite a bit, extremely) in each of the eight tasks (from left to right, top to bottom, the charts correspond to the tasks 1?8 as shown in Fig. 8). Most of the tasks could elicit multiple emotions or mixed emotions. However, there is still a principal emotion for each task. For the tasks such as task 2 (Documentary for Sadness), task 3 (Burst of Sound for Surprise/Startle), task 6 (Cold Pressor for Physical Pain), and task 8 (Smell for Disgust), the majority of votes are distributed in the highest (or second highest) grades, showing that the target emotion elicitation of those tasks was successful and the intensity of the corresponding emotions is strong. For task 7 (Insult for Anger/Upset), although the intensity of ?anger/upset? is not very strong, the ?anger/upset? emotion is still a major emotion of this task. In general, the self-report information shows the target emotions were elicited effectively. ### 4.2. Subjective rating and analysis #### 4.2.1. Expression labeling from naïve observers To evaluate the results of the emotion elicitation, we conducted a subjective rating experiment by asking naïve observers to label each video with two of the eight expressions for all the tasks. Five naïve observers were recruited to participate in the rating experiment. First, the purpose of the experiment was explained to the observer. Then, the observer watched the AU coded video segments of all subjects in the database. The videos were presented randomly in order to avoid any ordering effect, and the videos were also muted to ensure that their rating was only based on the visual information. For each video segment, eight expression labels were provided to choose from. The observer was asked to choose up to two most likely expressions in the order of their confidence. To indicate the confidence level of each choice, the observer used a three-scale list which represents _high confidence_ , _moderate confidence_ , and _low confidence_.The observer was allowed to replay the video segment if needed. A timer was started when a given video segment was started, and it was stopped when the final choices for the segment were made. In this way, the expression rating and judgment time were also recorded. If the target emotion of a task was recognized by an observer correctly, which means that the corresponding target expression was included in the top two choices by the observer, we count it as a correct recognition. The results show that the correct recognition rates of five naïve observers are 61% (happiness), 77.1% (sadness), 94.6% (startle), 65.9% (embarrassment), 73.2% (fear), 66.8% (pain), 55.1% (anger), and 83.4% (disgust). #### 4.2.2. Analysis of subjective ratings The inter-rater reliability was examined using Fleiss' kappa coefficient [37]. This has been used to assess the reliability of agreement between raters when assigning categorical ratings to a number of items. In our case, five raters assigned eight expression categories to all 328 video segments. The kappa value is in the range of ? 1 to 1, corresponding to a negative range (? 1, 0) and a non-negative range (0, 1). The non-negative value between 0 and 1 can be divided into 0.2 sized steps. Therefore, a total of 6 levels can be generated. Landis and Koch interpret the six levels as _poor_ , _slight_ , _fair_ , _moderate_ , _substantial_ , and _almost perfect_ agreement, respectively [63]. shows the Fleiss' kappa value for 8 expression categories. The overall kappa indicates moderate agreement between all observers. . Kappa coefficients from multiple raters for expression categories.

We assigned to the confidence levels _low_ , _moderate_ , and _high_ the values _0_ , _1_ , and _2_ , respectively. The judgment time factor is a value of a given judgment time divided by the length of the corresponding video segment of a task. If an observer spends more time to make a decision than the length of the video segment, the factor of the task is larger than 1. Otherwise, the factor is less than 1 if less time is used. lists the average values of confidence levels and the average values of judgment time factor. . Average value of confidence level and judgment time factor for expression categories.

The diagonal line shows the correct recognition rates. Among them, _startle_ , _disgust_ , and _sadness_ are among the three most distinguishable spontaneous expressions with the three highest recognition rates by observers. _Happiness_ is sometimes confused with _embarrassment_ as people sometimes show a soft smile in an embarrassing situation. For the improvisation task, subjects felt embarrassed, and, in the insult task, subjects could also feel embarrassed if they thought they had not performed well. It is not unusual for people to restrain their genuine negative emotions in social activities. People are likely to show a soft smile in an awkward situation to defuse tension. Thus, the smile could be misread by observers. . Confusion matrix for the relationship between target expression and observers' recognition.

However, in general, the correct classification rates for all the expressions in are still dominant when compared to the misclassification rates. The results are comparable to the results obtained with machine recognition (which will be described in Section 5.1). This shows that our elicitation method is effective when eliciting distinctive facial activities associated with different tasks. The distinctive dynamic information exhibited in spontaneous expressions benefits expression reading by human observers. ### 4.3. Action unit analysis #### 4.3.1. AU distribution in spontaneous expressions Holistic expressions of emotion can be defined in terms of one or more anatomic actions [52], [54], [55]. Following the previous work [16], [48], [49], [50], shows a mapping between AU(s) and the hypothetical emotion. shows the 27 action unit distributions across the eight tasks. The value is a percentage _P_ that is defined as follows:(3)P=NAUi/Ntwhere _N_ AUi is the number of frames that show the _i_ th coded AU of a task (i = 1, 2, ?, 27), and _N_ t is the total number of AU coded frames of the task (t = 1, 2, ?, 8). In this section, we report the extent to which holistic expressions defined using AUs corresponded to the target emotions. . Emotion description in terms of facial action units.

As we can see in, 41 subjects show genuine expressions which cover all the 27 action units. Also, the frequencies of different AU occurrence vary dramatically across both AUs and tasks. Unlike posed expressions, the facial action of spontaneous expressions appears involuntarily. In , AU 12 is related to happiness, and indeed a standard happy face contains AU 6 + 12. In , it shows that column T1 has a major occurrence of AU 6 (61.7%) and AU 12 (81.9%). However, it does not mean that AU 12 is unique to happiness. In fact, AU 12 occurred with varying frequencies in all tasks. This is consistent with the hypothesis that AU 12 (smiling) is not specific to positive emotion. While AU 12 is a defining feature of expressed enjoyment, it occurs in pain, embarrassment, and other negative emotions as well as in depression [51], [58], [59]. In , we know that _disgust_ has either AU 9 or AU 10 present, and task 8 (experience an unpleasant smell) gives the highest percentages of AU 9 (27.8%) and AU 10 (72.1%) among all tasks. AU 4 and AU 9are related to negative emotions. AU 4 shows relatively high percentages in negative emotion tasks such as T2 (43.6%), T6 (31.0%), and T8 (43.3%), while it shows low percentages in tasks for happiness (7.1%). Similar evidence can be found for AU 9. #### 4.3.2. Effectiveness of elicitation Besides participants' self-report and observers' rating report, we further study the AU distribution to verify the effectiveness of our emotion elicitation method objectively. Using the criteria listed in , we examine whether some AUs of the target emotions appear most frequently in the corresponding tasks. According to the percentage of AU sets that each task has in , the top two ranked tasks (in order from left to right) are illustrated in . The first column lists the AU criteria to be used for matching the corresponding target emotions (as the second column shows). For example, ?12, 24? means that either AU 12 or AU 24 needs to appear for the target emotion _Embarrassment_ ; and ?1 + 2 + 4, 1 + 2 + 5? means either AU 1 + 2 + 4 or AU 1 + 2 + 5 needs to appear for the target emotion _Fear/Nervous_. The third column shows the top two ranked tasks based on the corresponding AU counts from the spontaneous expressions of 41 subjects. It shows that the corresponding AUs appeared most frequently in the top two tasks. Moreover, these two top tasks always include the expected target emotion for all the cases (bold font). This verifies that our elicitation method is effective in eliciting the target emotions. As an example, in the second row, AU 4 is used as a criterion for matching the _sadness_ (task 2). As a result, AU 4 has the most frequent occurrence in task 2 based on . Therefore, the top ranked task is the _sadness_ task, which is exactly the expected target emotion. . Top two tasks based on FACS emotion descriptiona. AU criteria| Target emotion| Top two tasks indices ---|---|--- 12| Happiness/amusement| Embarrassment, **happiness** /**amusement** 4| Sadness| **Sadness** , disgust 5| Surprise/startle| **Startle** , sadness 12, 24| Embarrassment| **Embarrassment** , happiness/amusement 1 + 2 + 4, 1 + 2 + 5| Fear/nervous| **Fear** /**nervous** , startle 4 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 10| Physical pain| Disgust, **physical pain** 23| Anger/upset| Physical pain, **anger** /**upset** 9 + 10| Disgust| **Disgust** , physical pain a In the third column, the corresponding target emotion is in bold font. Therefore, we can see that the AU distribution of the BP4D-Spontaneous database verifies the distinctiveness of the spontaneous expressions. Similar to the results from the self-reported emotions, the findings for holistic expressions suggest that the tasks were effective in eliciting the target emotions. ## 5\\. Validation & application in facial expression analysis ### 5.1. 4D spontaneous facial expression recognition To validate the data for spontaneous facial expression recognition, we apply an existing 3D dynamic facial expression descriptor [42] for expression classification. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used to learn the temporal dynamics and spatial relationships of facial regions. To do so, a generic model is adapted to each range model of a 3D model sequence. The adaptation is controlled by a set of 83 key points based on the radial basis function (RBF). After adaptation, the correspondence of the points across the 3D range model sequence is established. We apply a surface labeling approach [42] to assigneach vertex one of eight primitive shape types. Thus, each range model in the sequence is represented by a ?label map?. We use Linear Discriminative Analysis (LDA) to transform the label map to an optimal compact space to better separate different expressions. Given the optimized features, an HMM is trained for each expression. Note that the HMM is applied to the optimal features of the label map rather than the trajectories of 83 landmarks. In recognition, the temporal/spatial dynamics of a test video is analyzed by the trained HMMs. As a result, the probability scores of the test video to each HMM are evaluated by the Bayesian decision rule to determine the expression type of the test sequence. We conducted a person-independent experiment on 41 subjects. Following a 10-fold cross-validation procedure, we used 39 subjects for training and 2 subjects for testing, and achieved an average correct recognition rate of 73.7% for distinguishing eight spontaneous emotional expressions. In order to make a comparison to the existing work [15], [42], where _six prototypic posed_ 3D dynamic facial expressions were used for recognition, we have also conducted an experiment for _six prototypic spontaneous_ 3D dynamic expression recognition using the same 41 subjects. The results show that the correct recognition rate is 76.1%. Note that spontaneous expressions are more difficult to classify than posed expressions. When the same approach was applied to the 3D posed dynamic facial expression database BU-4DFE [15], a recognition rate for classifying six posed prototypic expressions is 83%. The performance degradation on classifying 3D spontaneous expressions is due to the complexity, mixture, and subtlety of the spontaneous expressions in the new database. To further evaluate our approach, we conducted a comparison study by implementing the 3D static model-based approach using geometric primitive features [29] and the 2D texture-based approach using Gabor-wavelet features [31] to classify eight expressions from the entire BP4D-Spontaneous database. Note that we used two approaches in the case of the static image or static model. In the first approach, we chose an apex frame of each video sequence for the experiment. In the second approach, we chose three frames (a frame between onset and apex, apex frame, and frame between apex and offset); we then applied expression classification on the three frames individually. The output confidence levels (output scores measured by the probability of Naïve Bayesian Classifier) for the three frames were fused by averaging the output scores for each expression. Among 8 expressions, we chose the highest fused score as the recognized expression. The average recognition rates for the static model and static frame based approaches were 62.4% and 63.2%, respectively. The average recognition rates for the three-models and three- frames-based approaches were 65.7% and 66.8%, respectively. The three-frame fusion approach does show improved performance; however, the results are not as good as those from the 3D dynamic model-based approach (i.e., 73.7% as shown above for distinguishing eight spontaneous expressions from the entire database). ### 5.2. Cross-database 4D facial expression classification We also performed a cross-database validation on our new 4D spontaneous database. A posed facial expression database (BU-4DFE [15]) was used for training, and the spontaneous database was used for testing. We extended the idea of a 3D surface primitive feature into 4D space and developed a new feature representation: the so-called ?Nebula? features [41]. Given each vertex on the face, a local spatiotemporal volume is built from the neighbor points across all frames in a time window (in our experiment, window size is 15 frames). Spatial neighborhood radius sizes of 3, 5, and 7millimeters were tested, and the corresponding spatial voxel dimensions were 7 × 7, 11 × 11, and 15 × 15, respectively. The neighborhood data are voxelized (with _x_ , _y_ , _t_ as the dimensions and depth _z_ as the values) and fit to a cubic polynomial:(4)fxyt=A12x2+B12y2+C12t2+Dxy+Ext+Fyt+Gx3+Hy3+It3+Jx2y+Kx2t+Lxy2+My2t+Nxt2+Pyt2+Q x+Ry+St+U=z. The principal curvature directions and values are computed from the eigenvectors/eigenvalues of the Weingarten matrix:(5)ADEDBFEFC. A label is assigned based on the principal curvature values and a threshold _T_. Although this label compactly describes the shape of the feature, it does not give us its orientation. This orientation information is vital, since it can give us an indication of whether the surface changes across time or not. For example, consider two features with cylindrical shapes. Both have the same label; however, one may be oriented along the time axis, indicating no change across time, while the other may be perpendicular to the time axis, indicating a sharp change across time. Therefore, we use the label as well as the polar angles of the direction of least curvature as the values for each feature. The face area is then divided into regions. A 3D histogram is built for each region of the face with the features in that region. The variables for that histogram are the shape label and the two polar angles for each feature. The concatenated histograms from each of the regions give us our final feature vector. The construction of a single Nebula feature is shown in Fig. 10. 1. Download: Download high-res image (123KB) 2.

We selected data (happiness, disgust, and neutral) from BU-4DFE for training. We then tested directly on the spontaneous data using the Nebula feature approach. Our overall average accuracy was 71%. From the experiment, we find that Happy-Onset is often mistaken for Disgust-Onset. One possible explanation is that the spontaneous smiles, since they are mostly genuine smiles, also show activity around the eyes similar to some of the Disgust expressions; the posed smiles from BU-4DFE do not always demonstrate this. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a cross-database test on 4D expression data has been performed. Spontaneous expression data is almost invariably more difficult to classify than posed expression data. As a consequence, we believe our results are encouraging. ### 5.3. Action unit recognition on spontaneous 4D data We also performed experiments in AU recognition on BP4D-Spontaneous. We selected 16 subjects and tested on 12 AUs using a support vector machine classifier. Please note that we only tested on the AUs listed in , . In the database, the AUs are marked as present or not present for each annotated frame. Several 9-frame windows were extracted around several transition points (either near the apex frame or near the offset frame) for each AU. Segments without the AU in question were also extracted. With three different states per AU (?AU Onset?, ?AU Offset?, and ?No AU?), tests were conducted on each AU individually. . Spontaneous action unit recognition accuracy results: ?All? = all blocks used; ?Best? = best blocks used.

Specifically, block configurations with 15, 24, 35, 54, 77, and 96 blocks were tested. The number of rows and columns in each block region configuration was chosen to make the individual blocks square, given the size of the facial region. In addition to using all of the blocks of an entire face for a given configuration, we also tested using the ?best? blocks for each AU. The best set of blocks is chosen based on where the AU appears on the face. The best blocks are in effect either dividing the face into top and bottom halves or taking the middle third of the face. For example, since AU 15 occurs around the mouth, the ?best? region blocks for that AU are all the blocks in the lower half of the face; that is, the blocks on the top part of the face are excluded. In cases where the division of blocks was uneven, blocks were included rather than excluded (for instance, if the face was divided into 5 rows and we needed the top half of the face, rows 1, 2, and 3 were chosen). The Nebula feature approach was again employed here. We also tested using the LBP-TOP (Local Binary Patterns from Three Orthogonal Planes) [47] approach on the re-rendered, pose-normalized texture images and the corresponding depth images. The accuracy results for all three approaches are shown in , while the AUC (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) score results are shown in . The confusion tables using the Nebula feature approach for each AU (using the parameters yielding the best accuracies) are shown in .. _P_ score of paired _T_ -test on discrimination between pain and other emotion tasks on AU 6, AU 9, and AU 10. Task| T1| T2| T3| T4| T5| T7| T8 ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- T6| 0.01| 4.50 × 10? 7| 3.52 × 10? 4| 4.15 × 10? 5| 3.08 × 10? 4| 0.03| 0.02 . Spontaneous action unit recognition: confusion tables for best accuracies with nebula 4D approach. The average recognition AUC score using the ideal Nebula approach for each AU (i.e., all or ?best? blocks) was over 0.738. This validates the usefulness of the new database as well as demonstrates the effectiveness of the test approaches. The highest average accuracy among all approaches is 63.3% from Nebula on the ?best? blocks. Thus, we achieve over 4% better accuracy on average with the Nebula approach over the most accurate LBP-TOP approach (LBP- TOP 2D on all blocks). The AUC scores follow the same pattern, with Nebula on the ?best? blocks giving us 0.736 AUC while the best LBP-TOP score (LBP-TOP 2D on all blocks) is 0.689. In , a common source of confusion is the misclassification between onsets/offsets and non-existence of an AU. This may due to the fact that spontaneous expression data is more challenging for AU recognition than that for posed expression data. Note that in , , if we compare the ?best? region results between Nebula and LBP-TOP 2D for individual AUs, the former is always better than the latter one. For the ?all? region test, this is also true except for AU 1 and AU 12. We also note that in LBP-TOP 2D the textured image has been pose-normalized. The results can be worse for pure 2D-based recognition approaches. This proves that 3D face representation surpasses the 2D image representation by isolating the facial components such as expression, head pose and skin tone in this experiment. In our case, facial expression data can be extracted efficiently for our experiments. Contrariwise, to analyze expression in 2D, researchers need to carefully deal with challenges from pose prediction and skin color normalization, etc., and the error coming with the pre-processing stage can contaminate the training procedure. In short, we believe that the new data and our test approaches show promise. Further details are described in [41]. ### 5.4. Case study ? pain analysis with BP4D-spontaneous database To further validate the usefulness of the 4D spontaneous data, we choose the spontaneous expression _physical pain_ for a case study. The goal is to evaluate spontaneous pain appearance with automated AU recognition. In this case, the contributed AUs may be different from the typical AUs for pain listed in . To find the contributed AUs, we use the paired _t_ -test on the possible subset of pain AUs (AU 4, 6, 7, 9, 10) for all tasks of the database. This test is to assess whether pain and other spontaneous expressions are different in terms of the AU quantity. For each possible AU, the percentage of frames with this AU is reported for each task per subject. Here we find that in terms of AU quantity the differences between pain and all other expressions are significant with AU 6, AU 9, and AU 10 (_p_ < 0.05, shown in ). Therefore, the automated AU recognition system is built based on these three AUs. The positive data (AU appearance) set is acquired from task 6 (a total of 19,524 frames), while the negative data (No AU appearance) is from task 2 (a total of 20,837 frames) as it has the minimum _p_ value (4.50 × 10? 7). To generate the facial features, face normalization and feature registration procedures are applied through rotating the face model to a frontal view, cropping the 3D face region, and normalizing it to a standard size of a 72 × 72 matrix along with the landmark and pose information. Then, a Gabor waveletfilter with 3 spatial scales and 8 orientations is applied to generate the feature vector. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the feature dimension to 200. Three binary support vector machines (SVMs) are then trained with one label per frame using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel for three AUs separately. The output margin to the SVM hyper plane is used to generate the ROC curves. A leave-one-subject-out validation method is used for all 41 subjects in the database. Each test subject's sequence from task 2 and task 6 has been used as the negative test sequence and positive test sequence, respectively. The average AUC scores weighted by the positive sample numbers for AU 6, AU 9 and AU 10 are 0.865, 0.667, and 0.806 respectively. The pain appearance can be categorized in 8 (= 23) types, depending on the occurrence of each AU (0 or 1). If none of the three AUs appears, the face shows no pain. In Fig. 11(a?b), we illustrate the AU recognition performance, pain categories, and example frames. In each figure, sample frames are displayed on top. For AU 6, AU 9, and AU 10, each has been plotted with two curves, i.e., a green curve representing the automatic recognition result, and a dashed blue curve representing the ground truth from the binary AU coding. For each AU in a frame, it is labeled to 1 if the AU occurs, or 0 if the AU does not appear. Based on the eight kinds of combinations, different color indicates different pain appearances as shown in the bar ?pain categories?. ?Red? shows intense pain and ?Blue? shows no pain. 1.

Examples are the 1177th, 1290th, 1369th, and 1410th frames in the sequence. b: Physical pain appearance from a genuine pain sequence. Examples are the 14th, 99th, 203th, and 246th frames in the sequence. Fig. 11a shows the result of pain detection along a sequence of task 2, in which the subject was watching a documentary. The accuracy for AU 6 and AU 10 is 1, and the AUC score for AU 9 is 0.93. In such a non-pain activity, the subject did not show any pain expression according to AU 6, AU 9 and AU 10. The results match the ground-truth (dashed blue lines) very well in most of the sequence except for very few frames where a single AU 9 is falsely identified. Fig. 11b shows the pain detection results when the subject was submerging his hand in ice water (task 6). The AUC scores for AU 6 and AU 9 are 0.98 and 0.70, and the accuracy for AU 10 is 1. As an example, the second frame in Fig. 11b shows a less painful expression as compared to the others. Only AU 10 was detected for that frame. Thus, we have taken physical pain as a study case to show how the spontaneous expression data and the corresponding meta-data (AU codes, pose, and feature data) could be used for automated expression recognition. Based on this study, more applications of 3D-based pain analysis and further investigation of a complete set of pain-related AUs could be developed in the future. ## 6\\. Conclusion and future work In this paper, we reported our newly developed spontaneous 3D dynamic facial expression database (the so-called ?BP4D-Spontaneous? ? Binghamton?Pittsburgh 4D Spontaneous Facial Expression Database). Such a database can be a valuable resource to facilitate the research and development of human behavior analysis in security, HCI, psychology and biomedical applications. It is worth noting that stimulating genuine emotions with spontaneous facial expressions in a controlled environment is still a challenging issue. OurBP4D-Spontaneous data focused on facial actions that are not deliberately posed. Rather, they occur in the course of social interaction and other social or non-social stimuli. The guided format using a professional actor and director as the experimenter sought to simulate a more natural setting while guaranteeing high quality 3D/2D dynamic facial expression data. The AU annotation by expert coders provides valuable information about spontaneous facial behavior. However, the diversity of spontaneous expressions and the mixture of different expressions still pose big challenges for emotion and expression recognition. Expression analysis on 2D data suffers from head pose variation, illumination change, self-occlusion, etc. These influences can be removed or reduced by 3D representations. BP4D-Spontaneous addresses this issue by providing 3D time- varying spontaneous facial expression data. When we use ?Nebula? and LBP features to recognize AUs, we also noticed that the performance varies with different AUs. This may due to the different types of features exhibited by different AUs. For example, AU 4 and AU 9 create lines and furrows, while AU 25 reveals a new feature by showing teeth. That said, there may not be a panacea feature for recognition of all action units. In BP4D-Spontaneous, 3D/2D imaging data and the corresponding tracking points provide important information for feature distribution and discrimination. Combining the features from the 3D and 2D domains may improve the expression recognition performance. In future work, other settings and image capturing setups might be considered. Data quality could be improved by using a wider range imaging system which is more robust to different illumination conditions. The database will also be expanded to include more subjects. Moreover, our current database includes sequential geometric model data and texture data. In addition to the facial feature tracking algorithms, more powerful approaches need to be investigated in order to make the data processing and visualization fast and accurate. Automatic data annotation, registration, and efficient data representation (or compression) for micro- expression analysis will also be our next research direction. ## This material is based upon the work supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grants IIS-1051103, IIS-1051169, CNS-1205664, and CNS-1205195.
