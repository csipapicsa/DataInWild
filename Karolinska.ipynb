    "# The Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces\n",

    "\n",
    "The Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) dataset, used for studying facial expressions, appears to contain detailed information about emotional ratings and characteristics for different images. Here's a breakdown of what each column in the dataset represents based on the information you've provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **KDEF code**: A unique identifier for each image in the KDEF dataset. The code typically includes details like the subject and the facial expression displayed (e.g., \"M11AF\" might represent a male subject with an \"AF\" emotion).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Target emotion**: The intended or posed emotion that the subject is displaying in the image (e.g., Fearful, Happy, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Most rated emotion**: The emotion most frequently recognized or rated by participants who viewed the image. This may or may not match the target emotion (e.g., the subject may be posing as \"Fearful,\" but viewers might rate the emotion as \"Surprised\").\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Percentage (biased) hit rate**: The percentage of participants who correctly identified the target emotion. This is likely a measure of how accurately the emotion was recognized, but it might be biased by factors such as prior expectations or contextual clues.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mean intensity**: The average intensity rating of the emotion expressed in the image, as rated by participants. This indicates how strongly the participants felt the emotion was expressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **SD intensity**: The standard deviation of the intensity ratings. This measures the variability in participants' ratings of the emotion's intensity — a higher standard deviation suggests more variability in how different participants perceived the intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Mean arousal**: The average arousal rating of the emotion expressed in the image. Arousal refers to the level of excitement or activation associated with the emotion (e.g., \"Fear\" might generally be considered a high-arousal emotion, while \"Sadness\" might be low-arousal).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **SD arousal**: The standard deviation of the arousal ratings. This measures the variability in how different participants rated the arousal of the emotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Unnamed: 8**: This column seems to contain missing or `NaN` values and is likely an empty or unused column in the dataset. It might have been included accidentally during data processing or export.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Most rated non-target emotion(s)**: The emotion(s) that participants most frequently rated when they didn’t choose the target emotion. This column highlights which other emotions were commonly confused with the target emotion (e.g., participants might have rated \"Surprised\" when the target emotion was \"Fearful\").\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Percentage most rated non-target emotion(s)**: The percentage of participants who rated the non-target emotion(s). This shows how often participants identified another emotion as being more likely than the target emotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **Target emotion** refers to the intended emotion in the image.\n",
    "- **Most rated emotion** is the emotion participants thought was displayed.\n",
    "- **Percentage (biased) hit rate** indicates how often participants correctly identified the target emotion.\n",
    "- **Mean intensity** and **Mean arousal** measure how intense and arousing the emotion was perceived.\n",
    "- **SD intensity** and **SD arousal** show the variability in these ratings.\n",
    "- **Most rated non-target emotion(s)** and the associated percentage highlight common misclassifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset seems to be used for analyzing the recognition accuracy of different emotions and understanding how participants perceive emotional intensity and arousal in facial expressions."
