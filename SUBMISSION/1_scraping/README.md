### TO Run:
1) Run the 6 notebooks in "data_collection" in ascending order and then the merge notebook. This creates 'Scrapes_All.csv' in the 1_scraping folder.
2) Run the notebooks in "full_text_extraction" in ascending order. This will produce 3 files in the "results" which contain the full texts from each source.
3) Run the "AllFullTextsTOCSV" notebook to merge the 3 files produced in the previous step into "FullText_ALL.csv" which will be under the "/1_scraping/" folder
