### Folder structure

`dataset_finding`
- Has the notebooks and the data to produce the table of how many papers were found relating to our topic, 'Scrapes_All.csv'

`x_research_papers_save`
- Contains the notebooks and all the data in order to get the full texts from the papers we found in 'Scrapes_All.csv'

 `x_research_papers_save\1_raw_files`
 - contains papers in html from science direct

### TO Run:
1) Run the 6 notebooks in "dataset_finding" in ascending order and then the merge notebook. This creates 'Scrapes_All.csv' in the 1_scraping folder.
2) Run the notebooks in "x_research_papers_save" in ascending order. This will produce 3 files in the "xx_results" which contain the full texts from each source.
3) Run the "AllFullTextsTOCSV" notebook to merge the 3 files produced in the previous step into "FullTextscrapes.csv" which will be under the "/1_scraping/" folder
