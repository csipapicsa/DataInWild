39394531,"""Navigating the complexities of low-Grade glioma treatment: insights into SBT I-125 and novel assessment tools"".","Central nervous system tumors, classified by the WHO into four grades based on their aggressiveness, present significant challenges in treatment, particularly low-grade gliomas (LGGs) which, despite their slower growth, can progress to high-grade gliomas. Lucca B. Palavani and colleagues evaluated the efficacy and safety of SBT I-125 brachytherapy for LGMs in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 studies involving 988 patients. The analysis revealed an overall complication rate of 10%, with headaches and cyst formation being the most frequent issues. The five-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 66%, while the ten-year PFS rate was 30%, and the rate of malignant transformation was 26%. The mortality rate was 33%. Despite these findings, significant limitations were noted, including data insufficiencies, study heterogeneity, lack of randomized controlled trials, and potential publication bias. Inconsistencies in follow-up durations further hindered the evaluation of long-term efficacy and safety. Recent advancements in automated tumor assessment, such as Cheng et al.'s deep learning-based pipeline, are revolutionizing glioma management by enhancing the accuracy and consistency of tumor volume and RANO measurements. These innovations facilitate improved glioma grading, genetic mutation prediction, surgical planning, real-time intraoperative guidance, and histopathological analysis. Integrating such advanced tools into clinical practice can significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of glioma management. In conclusion, while SBT I-125 brachytherapy shows promise, concerns regarding safety and efficacy underscore the need for further research with standardized methodologies. Incorporating advanced automated assessment tools could improve treatment evaluation and patient outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10143-024-03028-1
39394414,Demonstration of high-frequency self-pulsing oscillations in an active silicon micro-ring cavity.,"We experimentally investigated the self-pulsing (SP) oscillations induced by the thermo-optic, free carrier, and Kerr nonlinear effects in integrated active silicon microring resonators. We demonstrate high frequency self-pulsing oscillations (up to 30 MHz) by applying a few millivolts of reverse bias voltage to the PIN junction of the active cavity. We illustrate that the shape of those oscillations (i.e., frequency and duty cycle) can be controlled by adjusting the CW input power and applying a reverse bias voltage to the PIN junction for carrier removal. This controlling is important for synchronizing the cavity which is crucial for neural network applications. Furthermore, we utilize a mathematical model for visualizing the stability regions by numerically studying coupled mode theory in silicon microcavity under different conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-75295-3

39392114,Nasal continuous positive airway pressure immediately after extubation for preventing morbidity in preterm infants.,"Preterm infants who are extubated following a period of invasive ventilation via an endotracheal tube are at risk of developing respiratory failure, leading to reintubation. This may be due to apnoea, respiratory acidosis, or hypoxia. Historically, preterm infants were extubated to head box oxygen or low-flow nasal cannulae. Support with non-invasive pressure might help improve rates of successful extubation in preterm infants by stabilising the upper airway, improving lung function, and reducing apnoea. This is an update of a review first published in 1997 and last updated in 2003.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD000143.pub2
39391725,Building a pangenome alignment index via recursive prefix-free parsing.,"Pangenomics alignment offers a solution to reduce bias in biomedical research. Traditionally, short-read aligners like Bowtie and BWA indexed a single reference genome to find approximate alignments. These methods, limited by linear-memory requirements, can only index a few genomes. Emerging pangenome aligners, such as VG, Giraffe, and Moni, address this by indexing more genomes. VG and Giraffe use a variation graph, while Moni indexes sequences accounting for repetition using prefix-free parsing to build a dictionary and parse. The main challenge is the parse's size, which becomes significantly larger than the dictionary. To scale Moni, we propose removing the parse from the construction of the run-length encoded BWT (RLBWT), suffix array, and Longest Common Prefix (LCP) by applying prefix-free parsing recursively. This approach improves construction time and memory requirements, enabling efficient construction of RLBWT, suffix array, and LCP for large pangenomes, such as those from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.110933
39391427,Artificial Intelligence in Predicting the Mode of Delivery: A Systematic Review.,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into obstetric care offers significant potential to enhance clinical decision-making and optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes. Traditional prediction methods for mode of delivery often rely on subjective clinical judgment and limited statistical models, which may not fully capture complex patient data. This systematic review aims to evaluate the current state of research on AI applications in predicting the mode of delivery, comparing the performance of AI models with traditional methods, and identifying gaps for future research. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, covering publications from January 2010 to July 2024. Inclusion criteria were studies employing AI techniques to predict the mode of delivery, published in peer-reviewed journals, and involving human subjects. Studies were assessed for quality using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST), and data were synthesized narratively due to heterogeneity. In total, 18 studies met the inclusion criteria, employing various AI models such as logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and neural networks. Sample sizes ranged from 40 to 94,480 participants across diverse geographic settings. AI models demonstrated high accuracy rates, often exceeding 90%, and strong predictive metrics (area under the curve (AUC) values from 0.745 to 0.932). Key predictors included maternal age, gravidity, parity, gestational age, labor induction type, and fetal weight. Notable models like the Adana SystemÂ and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost, Yandex LLC, Moscow, Russia) highlighted the effectiveness of AI in enhancing prediction accuracy and supporting clinical decisions. AI models significantly outperform traditional statistical methods in predicting the mode of delivery, providing a robust tool for obstetric care. Future research should focus on standardizing data collection, improving model interpretability, addressing ethical concerns, and ensuring fairness in AI predictions to enhance clinical trust and application.",https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.69115

39388221,Sensory-memory interactions via modular structure explain errors in visual working memory.,"Errors in stimulus estimation reveal how stimulus representation changes during cognitive processes. Repulsive bias and minimum variance observed near cardinal axes are well-known error patterns typically associated with visual orientation perception. Recent experiments suggest that these errors continuously evolve during working memory, posing a challenge that neither static sensory models nor traditional memory models can address. Here, we demonstrate that these evolving errors, maintaining characteristic shapes, require network interaction between two distinct modules. Each module fulfills efficient sensory encoding and memory maintenance, which cannot be achieved simultaneously in a single-module network. The sensory module exhibits heterogeneous tuning with strong inhibitory modulation reflecting natural orientation statistics. While the memory module, operating alone, supports homogeneous representation via continuous attractor dynamics, the fully connected network forms discrete attractors with moderate drift speed and nonuniform diffusion processes. Together, our work underscores the significance of sensory-memory interaction in continuously shaping stimulus representation during working memory.",https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.95160
39388401,LTPLN: Automatic pavement distress detection.,"Automatic pavement disease detection aims to address the inefficiency in practical detection. However, traditional methods heavily rely on low-level image analysis, handcrafted features, and classical classifiers, leading to limited effectiveness and poor generalization in complex scenarios. Although significant progress has been made with deep learning methods, challenges persist in handling high-resolution images and diverse disease types. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach based on the lightweight Transformer Patch Labeling Network (LTPLN) to enhance the efficiency of automatic pavement disease detection and overcome the limitations of existing methods. Firstly, the input images undergo histogram equalization preprocessing to enhance image quality. Subsequently, the images are evenly partitioned into small patch blocks, serving as inputs to the enhanced Transformer model. This enhancement strategy involves integrating feature map labels at each layer of the model to reduce computational complexity and enhance model lightweightness. Furthermore, a depthwise separable convolution module is introduced into the Transformer architecture to introduce convolutional bias and reduce the model's dependence on large amounts of data. Finally, an iterative training process utilizing the label distillation strategy based on expectation maximization is employed to update the labels of patch blocks and roughly locate the positions of pavement diseases under weak supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the baseline model, the proposed enhanced model achieves a reduction of 2.5G Flops computational complexity and a 16% speed improvement on a private pavement disease dataset, with only a 1.2 percentage point decrease in AUC accuracy. Moreover, compared to other mainstream image classification models, this model exhibits more balanced performance on a public dataset, with improved accuracy and speed that better align with the practical requirements of pavement inspection. These findings highlight the significant performance advantages of the LTPLN model in automatic pavement disease detection tasks, making it more efficiently applicable in real-world scenarios.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0309172

39385758,Rating pome fruit quality traits using deep learning and image processing.,"Quality assessment of pome fruits (i.e. apples and pears) is used not only for determining the optimal harvest time but also for the progression of fruit-quality attributes during storage. Therefore, it is typical to repeatedly evaluate fruits during the course of a postharvest experiment. This evaluation often includes careful visual assessments of fruit for apparent defects and physiological symptoms. A general best practice for quality assessment is to rate fruit using the same individual rater or group of individual raters to reduce bias. However, such consistency across labs, facilities, and experiments is often not feasible or attainable. Moreover, while these visual assessments are critical empirical data, they are often coarse-grained and lack consistent objective criteria. Granny, is a tool designed for rating fruit using machine-learning and image-processing to address rater bias and improve resolution. Additionally, Granny supports backward compatibility by providing ratings compatible with long-established standards and references, promoting research program continuity. Current Granny ratings include starch content assessment, rating levels of peel defects, and peel color analyses. Integrative analyses enhanced by Granny's improved resolution and reduced bias, such as linking fruit outcomes to global scale -omics data, environmental changes, and other quantitative fruit quality metrics like soluble solids content and flesh firmness, will further enrich our understanding of fruit quality dynamics. Lastly, Granny is open-source and freely available.",https://doi.org/10.1002/pld3.70005

39381788,Effect of Low- and High-Level Laser Therapy on the Treatment of Dentin Hypersensitivity: An Umbrella Review.,"Introduction: Dentin hypersensitivity (DH) is a prevalent unpleasant condition which might affect quality of life. Laser therapy is one of the non-invasive treatments for dentin hypersensitivity. The aim of this umbrella review was to assess the effect of lasers on the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity by analyzing the previously published systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Methods: Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and ISI) were searched to identify relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses based on the keyword search strategy. Two independent reviewers carried out the selection of studies, extraction of data, and assessment of methodological quality. The actual overlap of primary studies was measured through the visual tool known as the citation matrix and three indices of % overlaps, covered area (CA), and corrected covered area (CCA). The reviews were appraised for methodological quality through A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR)-2, and the risk of bias was evaluated using the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool. Results: Following eliminating duplicates, a total of 2,768 articles were found, and of them, 9 systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Six of them included a meta-analysis as well. The actual overlap of primary studies was low. The AMSTAR 2 tool classified one systematic review as high quality, three as moderate quality, three as low quality, and the remaining two as critically low quality. The results of the included reviews generally showed that all types of lasers reduced dentin hypersensitivity compared to placebo/no treatment. Conclusion: Lasers are effective in treating dentin hypersensitivity.",https://doi.org/10.34172/jlms.2024.41
